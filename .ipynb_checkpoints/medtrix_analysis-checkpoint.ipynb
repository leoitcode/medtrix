There is no hemorrhage, mass effect,\\nshift of midline structures, or evidence of major vascular\\nterritorial infarction. Unchanged bilateral basal ganglia\\ncalcifications. There is mild right maxillary sinus mucosal\\nthickening\\n(3:2).\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.\\n2. Apparent increase in hypodensity at right occipital\\ncraniectomy site. MRI\\nw/ gadolinium recommended to evaluate for tumor recurrence.\\n# CXR [**2161-2-13**]: (prelim) no acute cardiopulmonary process\\n# MRI spine [**2161-2-15**]: Evaluation of the cervical spine\\ndemonstrates no evidence for osseous metastatic disease.\\nMultilevel spondylosis is seen including a disc osteophyte\\ncomplex at C5/C6\\nand C6/C7. There is also a left paracentral disc protrusion\\nwhich is\\nbroad-based at C6/C7 extending into the foramen. There is\\nmoderate stenosis\\nat these two levels.\\nThere is a small nonspecific lesion in the right thyroid lobe\\nmeasuring\\napproximately 7 mm.\\nThere is no epidural disease seen.\\nEvaluation of the thoracic and lumbar spine demonstrates mild\\nmarrow\\nhypointensity. There is high signal within the sacrum which may\\nbe related to prior radiation to the rectum. No convincing\\nevidence for epidural or\\nintradural metastatic disease is seen. There is a central to\\nleft paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 causing left lateral\\nrecess narrowing and then abutting the left L5 nerve root.\\nThere is heterogeneous appearance to the iliac wings bilaterally\\nwhich again may be related to prior radiation.\\nThe pre- and para-vertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.\\nIMPRESSION:\\nNo evidence for metastatic disease.\\nDegenerative changes in the cervical and lumbar spine as\\ndetailed.

The\\nelectrophysiologic abnormalities are most consistent with a\\nmoderate generalized neuropathy with demyelinating and axonal\\nfeatures. The sural nerve is spared. Given the time course of\\nprogression, the findings are consistent with an acquired\\nneuropathy such as [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] syndrome. The low amplitude\\nmotor responses may or may not be due to axonal involvement; a\\nfollow-up study would clarify the extent of axonal involvement\\nif indicated.\\n\\n\\nPRIOR STUDIES:\\n# Torso CT [**2161-2-12**]:\\n1.

Post-radiation changes in the perirectal region. No bowel\\nobstruction.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n56M with rectal carcinoma s/p resection, chemoradiation who was\\nreferred to ED for R common iliac DVT and was found to be\\nfebrile.  He was treated with Lovenox, empiric antibiotics,\\nhowever developed progressive weakness initially concerning for\\nspinal cord compression (MRI pan spine showed no cord\\ncompression, while MRI of head showed a stable cerebellar\\nherniation through craniotomy site without evidence of\\ninfection).  His exam progressed to bilateral leg weakness,\\nworsened bilateral hand and lower leg numbness, tongue numbness,\\nand dysphagia to liquids and solids and patient developed\\nprogressive loss of reflexes.  He underwent LP and was diagnosed\\nwith GBS.  He was transferred from Medicine Service to Neurology\\nService on [**2161-2-22**].\\n\\n# GBS\\nPatient with ascending weakness, loss of reflexes and CSF with\\nalbuninocytologic dissociation.   His NIF and vital capacity\\napparently declined while in medical ICU and he was intubated on\\n[**2161-2-20**] based on above and in setting of tachypnea. Completed 4\\ndays of IVIG on [**2161-2-21**].  His strength slowly improved, however\\nthere remained mild assymetry of L > R weakness (including face)\\nas well as more proximal vs. distal weakness.  He has made\\nsteady improvement throughout his recovery phase, and is at\\nleast antigravity strength in all muscle groups at the time of\\ndischarge.\\n\\n# Weakness and parathesias: Overnight [**2-14**] patient developed\\nneurologic sxs concerning for cord compression of the low\\ncervical or high thoracic vertabrae, however normal spinal MRI\\nwithout compression. [**Month (only) 116**] also be complicated by cerebellar mets\\nand chemo induced neuropathy. Neurology and neurosurgery\\nfollowed the patient and he was maintained on standing\\ndexamethasone which was subsequently discontinued given negative\\nimaging. He failed a speech and swallow and was determined to be\\nlikely aspirating on [**2-17**] so was changed to Levo/Flagyll.  He\\nsubsequently proved to have steadily improving oropharyngeal\\ncontrol, and was taking all calories PO at the time of\\ndischarge.\\n\\nOf note, at admission the patient did have diarrhea, though he\\nwas camplobacter negative.  Also on [**2-18**] the patient developed\\ndyspnea with a RR to the low 20s and maintance of oxygen\\nsaturation in the 90s on RA. He developed urinary retention\\n(bladder scan with 500cc) though also may have been holding in\\nhis urine due to physical difficulty using urinal. He developed\\ndifficulty managing his secretions with NIFs -20 to -30 and was\\nthen transferred to the ICU.\\n\\nA bedside LP was attempted on [**2-17**] and was unsuccessful.  On [**2-18**]\\nthe patient had an IR guided LP revealing elevated protein with\\n1 WBCs.  A diagnosis of GBS was made based on progressive\\nweakness and loss of reflexes (see above for GBS management).\\n\\n# DVT: R common iliac thrombus seen on outpatient CT. LENIS\\nshowed no lower clot.  Enoxaprin was initially started and then\\nheld starting [**2-16**] for an LP.  He was switched to Heparin SC TID\\nduring that interval and changed back to Lovenox on [**2-18**].  He\\ncontinues on treatment doses of Lovenox.\\n\\n# Fever: Given recent chemotherapy, was initially concerning for\\ninfection. However, patient was not neutropenic. Bandemia\\nreflects recent Neulasta administration. No evidence of sepsis.\\nCXR, u/a, UCx were unremarkable. Fever might also be related to\\nDVT or chemo itself.  At admission patient was maintained on\\nCefepime/Vanc. After switch to Levofloxacin he spiked and was\\nthus changed back to Cefepime/Vanc before being changed to\\nLevo/Flagyll as above with plan to continue for 7 days.\\nFollowing completion of this course he remained fever-free.\\n\\nAll of infectious evaluations proved to be unrevealing including\\nBCx, UCx, Stool Cx, C.diff Assay, Legionella antigen, sputum and\\nBAL washings.  Antibiotics were thus discontinued on [**2-22**].  He\\ncontinued to have intermittent low grade fevers (101F) which\\nwere attributed to DVT.\\n\\n# Rectal cancer: No intervention done this admission.  Patient\\nshould follow up with Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office one month\\nfollowing discharge from the hospital.
