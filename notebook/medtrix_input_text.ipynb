Over the weekend, complained of a frontal headache -- intense, unusual for him. His headache worsened over the weekend and by [**5-3**] was severe.

Hct was 32.9 on admission with a baseline in low 40's as of [**10-18**] (MCV unchanged). Given he was not tachycardic or orthostatic, he did not receive an RBC transfusion in the ED. . Of note, the patient is on warfarin for stroke/TIA (?); ED notes say had a DVT in RLE one month ago and has been on Coumadin since that time, though has older rxn in OMR. His INR was noted to be 14.1 on admission. He was given 10 mg IV Vit K; two units of FFP have been ordered but not yet administered. The ED staff also spoke with the cards fellow given the recent stent placement (in right ? LE artery for PVD); they advised to keep on ASA and plavix currently. . ENT saw him in the ED and did a flex scope and standard anterior rhinoscopy. They noted several areas of oozing along the septum bilaterally w/o a clear single, brisk source. Gauze soaked in bacitracin was placed in the right nares. Left nares was packed with gelfoam and surgicell packing. Oral cavity clear. .

Following cath, she developed cardiogenic shock, for which she was temporarily treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump, levophed and milrinone. She was eventually weaned off all these. She was started on aspirin, atorvastatin and digoxin. (She had been on OCPs on admission which were dc'd). TTE from [**2147-3-8**] showed an EF of 25% with septal, anterior and apical akinesis. A repeat TTE was performed on [**2147-3-16**] to assess for interval improvement, but there was no change in cardiac function. Pt also had low-grade fevers throughout her hospitalization. Prior to last admission, she was treated with a full course of ciprofloxacin for a UTI. All blood cultures were negative and UA negative. She was put on a five day course of vancomycin empirically for possible line infection (it was thought that she may have had transient bacteremia from the catherization instrumentation, even thought cultures were negative). She was also given a five day course of azithromycin for a possible community acquired PNA given a LUL infiltrate on CXR. Despite the course of azithromycin, her fevers persisted and there was worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity. She was started on a seven day course of IV cefepime and vancomycin for hospital acquired pneumonia. A PICC line was placed in the left arm on [**2147-3-18**] for out-patient administration of IV antibiotics. During her stay, there was also concern for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, given her MI at a young age, with few cardiac risk factors and given elevated PTT.

The patient reports that she has had a sense of head congestion with rhinorrea for the last three days, associated with some progressive dyspnea. She has also had a chronic cough for the last six months, but it has become productive of yellowish sputum. Today, the patient had a mechanical fall while ambulating with her walker and hit her left chest. EMS was called to the patient's home, however she felt well at the time of their evaluation and did not go to the ED. Later in the day, with increasing dyspnea, she did decided to come to the ED. In the ED, initial vitals were 96.1, 79, 106/57, 20, 98% on RA. She was treated with nebs and PO prednisone and apparently appeared well. She was offered the opportunity for discharge with PCP f/u, however indicated she would feel more comfortable with admission. On arrival to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**], the patient was quickly noted to be in severe respiratory distress. Additional nebs were administered along with methylprednisolone. The patient was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was initially unable to provide much history secondary to her respiratory distress. Emperic BPAP was initiated, which the patient tolerated well. Within 15 minutes, she had improved markedly and was able to begin answering some questions. During this period, she was intermittently noted to be tachycardiac as high as the 140s and hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s-80s; this all improved as her respiratory status stabalized. On ROS, the pt endorses pleuritic chest pain just above the right breast where she fell earlier today. She also notes that her LE may be slightly swollen as compared to baseline; she does not believe she has had significant weight gain. No other chest discomfort or palpitations. No fevers or chills.

Hct checked at OSH was 27 (down from a baseline in the high 30s). Her [**Hospital1 18**] Hematologist referred her to our ED for further evaluation. On presentation, BP in the 90/60 range with HR 60-70 (takes low-dose BB at home) and patient in no acute distress complaining of some mild fatigue and lightheadedness. Hct in ED 27.9 with plts of 74. She was given 2L NS in the ED, 1 pack of plts, and 1 U pRBC. Rectal exam in the ED was notable for guiaic positive brown stool. NG Lavage was requested, but not performed. . An abdominal CT was done for further evaluation of the abdominal pain, which she has had since having a hysteroscopy + D&C done on [**2194-3-27**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. Per preliminary read, it showed a cirrhotic liver with some peri-hepatic fluid, but was otherwise unremarkable for source of Hct drop. GI was consulted and recommended PPI bolus + drip, they will evaluate her this AM. . On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient reports that she has been feeling weakness and fatigue since her recent hospital discharge, occasional increased dyspnea on exertion, and intermittent chest pain. She denies hematemesis or hematochezia. Regarding her recent hospitalization, she reports that she presented to OSH for evaluation of an excruciating headache. She states she had a reaction to the anesthesia from her recent procedure possibly complicated by depakote therapy, and had high ammonia levels. She spent two weeks in the hospital and at that time her Depakote was weaned off and Keppra started. . Review of sytems: + per HPI - for fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, prutitus, dysuria, rashes. No hx of known liver disease, hepatitis, blood transfusions, or IV drug use.  \n",

The patient was in her USOH including being able to walk across the room without becoming SOB or stopping until approx. 2 days ago. She reports progressive dyspnea on exertion and now dyspnea at rest over the last 2 days. She is now unable to walk across the room without becoming SOB. She has also had a chronic cough for the last thirty years that is usually non-productive but has become productive of thick yellow sputum over the last 2 days. Denies hemoptysis. Denies fevers or chills at home. She denies CP, N/V, dysuria, urgency, frequency, HA, neck stiffness. No sick contacts. She received the influenza vaccine this year. She endorses a 10lb unintentional weight loss over the last month [**1-25**] poor appetite. She also endorses severe back pain that has been progressive over the last 3-4 weeks and was initially intermittent but is now constant. The pain is pleuritic in nature. She denies a h/o falls or trauma to the back. She has had back pain in the past but nothing similar to this. She denies other bony pain besides in the back. She endorses night sweats for the last ten days or so. She also has intermittent colitis flares, and has had one recently with no abdominal pain but [**3-28**] watery or loose BMs/day. She denies melena or hematochezia. She underwent colonoscopy in [**2169-4-23**] and reports that polyps removed had no evidence of cancer on pathology. . Regarding the patient's RLL mass, it was incidentally discovered on a CXR in [**2169-7-24**] after her chronic cough of 30 years intensified this summer. Her outside pulmonologist recommended CT scan and on CT there was a peripherally located, broad based RLL lesion. She was prescribed Augmentin but was only able to complete 3 days [**1-25**] GI upset. Repeat CT scan 1 month later was unchanged and decision was made to seek further investigation at [**Hospital1 18**].  On [**2169-10-25**] she underwent flexible bronchoscopy by IP service with normal airway surveillance. \"Radial EBUS via the R basilar posterior segment showed a mass at 4cm from entrance from such subsegment\". Brushings and washings were taken and BAL was done. She reports her cough has been worse since her bronchoscopy. Initial pathology on brushings/washings were positive for malignancy but after review this was equivocal and it was recommended to obtain more tissue. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in thoracic surgery on [**11-7**] who recommended CT-guided core needly biopsy which was to be done on [**2169-11-20**]. . At the OSH, initial VS 98 108 120/54 16 94% 2L NC. Labs notable for WBC 25.9 with 30% bands, Cr 0.97.CXR showed RLL infiltrate. She was given a Duoneb and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: 99.8 96 102/42 19 94% 2L NC. CXR showed RLL infiltrate consistent with pnemonia. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with non specific ST changes anteriorly. Labs notable for WBC 22.9 with 88%N and 7% bands, Hct 33.5 (most recent 36), BUN 32, Cr 1.3, Mg 1.3, Phos 2.4, trop neg x1. Blood cultures and sputum culture was drawn and Foley was placed. Patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn. She was given codeine and benzonatate for cough, Tylenol 1 gram for fever, Mag sulfate for repletion, hydrocortisone 50mg given known chronic prednisone use. Initial lactate was 5.5, she was given 5L NS, repeat lactate 2.5 with subjective improvement in symptoms. She was seen by thoracic surgery who recommended MICU admission and they will follow along. VS at transfer: 99.4 94 109/50 16 97% 4L NC. . Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports feeling much better overall since presentation. She denies any SOB and says the codeine helped her back pain and cough tremendously.  \n",

Per this discussion, pt's code status was changed from DNR/DNI to full code. . He was admitted on [**10-19**] to  MICU .He was treated with broad spectrum abx.Only positive cultures were urine with yeast.Stool with c.difficile. Antibiotics were tailored to flagyl only to treat for c. difficile.  A new family  meeting was held and patient was made DNR/DNI by his daughter. . Patient was transferred to the a Medicine floor 3 days after admission . After a staying on the floor for 4 days he  was transferred back to the medical ICU d/2 respiratory distress .This happened  soon after contrast for a CT scan of the abdomen  was administered through  the PEG tube. Patient's oxygenation was escalated from nasal cannula to face mask to NRB, with sats initially in mid-70s and improving to mid-90s with aformentioned interventions. Patient also noted to be rigoring, and demerol was administered via IV. Concern for aspiration event vs. sepsis. Patient with accompanying tachycardia to 150s (baseline 100s-120s), BP stable with systolic in 110-120s He was admitted to the MICU for further managament.  \n",

The history is obtained from the chart only as the patient is Portugese speaking.  Mr. \u001b[1m[**Known lastname 303**]\u001b[0m was transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 2063**] after presenting with hematemesis on [**1-3**].  He had a first episode at 6 am on the morning of presentation, five episodes of bright red blood per mouth associated with some nausea.  He also relates some melena and two episodes of syncope at home along with persistent lightheadedness. Patient in addition, had an episode of rectal bleeding now for a few months, although he denies any abdominal pain.  Patient has a long history of alcohol abuse, but no other complications from the alcohol abuse per report.  Upon admission, the patient's hematocrit was 40.3 and his coags were normal.  The patient apparently last drank at 2 am the morning of admission.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed at outside hospital which showed severe acute and chronic esophagitis. Varices were not definitively identified, but there is a deep esophageal ulcer tear with the bleeding vessel that was treated with BiPAP and epi in the lower esophagus.  There is also bleeding vessel just below the GE junction which was injected with good hemostasis.  Three clips were placed. There was no banding of any vessels due to fibrosis.  The patient was intubated for airway protection and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells, and had a repeat hematocrit of 39.5.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] MICU for further management.  Initially, he was evaluated by the Thoracic Surgery Service, as it was felt he was high risk for rebleed due to his \u001b[1m[**Doctor First Name **]\u001b[0m-\u001b[1m[**Doctor Last Name **]\u001b[0m tear.  However, Surgery felt that no other intervention was necessary from a surgical standpoint.  At that point, he was then transferred to the MICU for potential alcohol withdrawal and further management of his gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was changed to CPAP with pressure support the day following admission.  \n",

      "TEXT:  This was a 51-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, and cirrhosis, status post gastrojejunostomy secondary to duodenal stricture with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, intermittent exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis, and osteoporosis.  The patient was admitted on [**2145-11-15**], and presented with the presumptive diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, metabolic alkalosis, sudden onset, which was thought to be secondary to decompensated liver failure.  She was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Medicine Service where she was cared for initially on the floor and evaluated by the Liver Service as well.  On [**2145-11-16**], the patient received a CT scan which demonstrated a probable small bowel obstruction.  Given her continued decompensation, it was thought to be a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, worsening .................. status.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the \u001b[1m[**Hospital Ward Name 516**]\u001b[0m.  On [**11-16**], a Surgery consult was obtained.  On review of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, it was noted that there was a question of small bowel obstruction per CT scan; however, given the patient met criteria for Child C cirrhosis, was a very poor surgical candidate.  A series of discussions were undertaken with the family as to whether or not they wished to pursue surgical correction of the small bowel obstruction.  It was decided by the family they would pursue this option, and on the evening of [**2145-11-17**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room by \u001b[1m[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\u001b[0m where she underwent exploratory laparotomy.  At the time, it was noted that the patient had a thick adhesion upon which there was a lobulized loop of jejunum. An approximate 10 cm segment of the jejunum was resected. The patient tolerated this procedure.  She was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on the \u001b[1m[**Hospital Ward Name 516**]\u001b[0m.  Over night from [**11-17**], until the evening of [**11-18**], the patient was noted to be increasingly alkalotic despite supportive care measures by the Intensive Care Unit staff.  It was decided, with the patient becoming progressively more obtunded, her abdomen more distended, difficulties managing her blood pressure, and acid based status, to return with the patient to the Operating Room on the evening of [**2145-11-18**].  At that time, the patient underwent a second exploratory laparotomy where she was noted to have a large amount of peritoneal fluid which was evacuated by suction.  At that time, exploratory laparotomy, there was evidence of diffuse ischemic and infarctive disease of the small bowel.  At that time, it was decided to close the patient and return her to the Intensive Care Unit.  Discussions with the family where undertaken, and it was decided at that time to withdraw support and make the patient COMFORT CARE MEASURES ONLY.  The patient was taken off pressors and intravenous fluids in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  She was bolused with Dilaudid.  Approximately 45 min after withdraw of support, the patient expired. Following this, the family declined a postmortem examination.  \n",

      "TEXT:   At that time she was admitted for an elective procedure for lumbar decompression. The patient had been confined to a wheelchair, and therefore, it was felt that despite her advanced age she was an acceptable surgical risk for surgery to correct the spinal stenosis. Following surgery, she was in severe pain treated with very high doses of morphine and was noted to be very lethargic with a decreased right arm and incoherent speech.  CT of the brain was done on [**9-2**] that was normal, but she continued to not be able to arouse. MRI was done on [**9-3**] which showed a left occipital 1 X 1 hemorrhage on susceptibility weighted imaging with blood layering out posteriorly in both lateral ventricles. There were no areas of restricted diffusion, no mass affect or shift was noted. The patient was then evaluated by Neurology, that noted the patient to be quite lethargic, but able to open her eyes and answer questions. She did indeed appear to be weaker on the right and very weak in both legs bilaterally. A test dose of Narcan managed to improved her symptoms suggesting that most of her symptoms were due to the high dose of morphine that she received post-op. During the next few days she did improve  especially in her mental status and strenght in her upper extremities. On [**9-4**], due to the decreased mental status a repeat head CT was obtained which now showed the blood seen in the ventricles and in the left occipital lobe, but no other acute changes. Becaouse of concern that she may not be able to protect her airways due to sedation, the patient was kept in the Intensive Care Unit during this entire time. During her ICU stay as she was noted to develop decreasing strength in her legs bilaterally both proximally and distally, and it was noted that her reflexes which had previously been intact  were now decreased. It was therefore decided to emergently obtain a MRI of the lumbar spine which demonstrated an L3-L4 and L4-L5 epidural hematoma. She was taken back to the operating room on [**9-7**], where the epidural hematoma was evacuated and a drain was left in place. Following the surgery she did much better.  Her strength began to return to her legs, and her reflexes were also noted to be better. Postoperatively, the question was whether or not to restart her on her anticoagulation because of her atrial fibrillation which had been held due to her recent surgery and also to the fact that she had a hemorrhage in the surgical site.  Cardiology was consulted, and they felt that anticoagulation she should be restarted on Coumadin. She was started on Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy, who worked initially with her with passive range of motion but later in the course was able to sit up in a chair, able to stand for brief period; although, she was not yet able to walk. From a mental status point of view, she did better upon transfer out of the unit and appeared to be doing well. However, a few days later she was noted again to have a waxing and \u001b[1m[**Doctor Last Name 688**]\u001b[0m course.  Further investigation revealed that she was sleeping poorly at night and more during the day, and it was felt that this may have represented a derangement of her sleep/awake cycle, and she was placed on trazodone for sleep prophylaxis.  It was noted that certain times during the day she was very alert and seemed to be doing very well, so further imaging was held off on.  She continued to have difficulties with poor swallowing, and it was felt that no neurological abnormality could be found for this.  She had a number of video swallow studies which all demonstrated a weak swallow mechanism.  She was fed via nasogastric tube during this time.  An ENT consultation was obtained which is still pending at this time, but the suspicion was that this may be due to vocal cord injury secondary to intubation during the surgery.  \n",

She then underwent an echocardiogram which confirmed moderate to severe aortic stenosis but showed only mild mitral regurgitation. Cardiac surgery consulted on patient for surgical intervention. She underwent multiple diagnostic work-up prior to surgery which included CNIS, chest CT, and dental consult. Over then next several days she received medical management awaiting Plavix work-out before surgery. On [**9-26**] she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 and aortic valve replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologcially intact and extubated. On post-op day one she had an episode of SVT which was cardioverted electrically and started on Amiodarone. She had her chest tubes removed and was weaned off of Neo-Synephrine. On post-op day two she was started on diuretics and beta blockers. She was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Her epicardial pacing wires were removed and she was transferred to the SDU. Also on this day she received blood transfusion for low HCT. On post-op day three she again had episode of SVT which converted to SR. She was started on Coumadin. On post-op day four pulmonary medicine consulted on Ms. \u001b[1m[**Known lastname **]\u001b[0m for pre-op w/u that revealed apical nodule densities.

Her hospital course, by problem: . #) Fever/tachycardia: She was admitted with fever and back pain, which prompted a lumbar puncture (results were negative). These fevers initially resolved during the first few days of her hospital course, and restarted overnight on [**9-7**].  On [**9-7**] she also developed a new leukocytosis and was started on Vancomycin on [**9-7**] for this to cover for possible skin infection (cellulitis) causing fever.  She had a CK that remained elevated, and that we attributed to her rigors on admission.  An ABG on [**2110-9-3**] displayed a slight respiratory alkalosis consistent with hyperventilation.  She was given scheduled tylenol for her persistent fevers.  Throughout the admission, blood cultures grew Strep viridans, micrococcus, stomatococcus, veillonella, \u001b[1m[**Female First Name (un) 564**]\u001b[0m albicans, and lactobacillus. HIV negative. TTE/TEE have been negative for endocarditis, ophthalmology exam negative for endophthalmitis, no evidence of dental pathology on dental exam and panorex, no evidence of foreign bodies. CT abd/pelvis unrevealing. Etiology of positive blood cultures with these organisms points to contamination of PICC with oral flora. The PICC was pulled out on [**2110-9-16**]. Patient has been afebrile x 72+ hours. She was put on vancomycin and Zosyn IV and oral fluconazole and transitioned to oral antibiotics (Augmentin 875mg PO TID, clindamycin 450mg PO QID, fluconazole 400mg PO DAILY) for discharge; total course to be 14 days (last day of antibiotics [**2110-9-30**]). At the time of discharge, she had been afebrile for >96 hours. From an infectious disease perspective, she is stable for discharge to psychiatric inpatient unit. . #) Respiratory distress. Patient's O2 saturation decreased to 76% on room air during episode of rigors with fevers on [**9-8**]. ABG showed hypoxemia. CXR unrevealing.  She required overnight observation in the medical ICU, during which her oxygen saturations were stable on 2L nasal cannula. After one night, she was transferred back to the floor ([**2110-9-9**]), and she continued to sat well on room air without event. . #) Psych. Patient's belongings were searched on [**9-8**] due to suspicion of illicit drug use and injecting into the PICC. Several syringes and syringe adapters were confiscated, as were a Dilaudid prescription bottle and Neurontin tablets. Tox screen was positive for opiates (known; patient getting dilaudid). Phone conversation with patient's mother elucidated substantial psych and substance abuse history. High suspicion that patient has been tampering with PICC. The patient had a 1:1 sitter 24 hours per day, including in the bathroom and shower. It was determined that the patient could not leave the hospital without first being seen by psychiatry. . #) Atypical chest pain. Resolved with hospitalization.  A PE was ruled out in the ED via negative CTA, nothing focal was noted on the scan. Unlikely MI/Ischemia as no anginal symptoms (though she is female and a diabetic so symptoms may be atypical). She had two negative sets of enzymes. . #) Migraines: her admission migraine headache was consistent with prior migraines however lasting longer than usual. An MRI of the head showed no evidence of previous stroke. It has been mildly responsive to phenergen and dilaudid. Had c/o right eye pain, no pathology detected on MRI/MRA, cont to have difficulty opening eye. \u001b[1m[**Doctor First Name **]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Doctor First Name 68354**]\u001b[0m (her VWD hemotologist) hasn't seen her since [**2108**] and could provide no further information about her stroke or migraines.  She was continued on PO phenergan, Dilaudid 4mg q4h PRN, and standing Tylenol. In addition, her Neurontin was continued. . #) Left wrist pain: cellulitis/thrombophlebitis. Improved with warm compresses and antibiotics (vancomycin). No evidence of foreign body in left wrist per X-ray. . #) Right hand/finger pain: cellulitis due to recent IV access. No streaking up arm. Thrombophlebitis on RUE ultrasound. Improved with warm compresses and antibiotics (vancomycin). . #) Lower back pain. Patient complained of exquisite pain on palpation of LP site, resolved with rest and pain medications as noted above. . #) Anemia. Her anemia has been previously documented with unknown cause. Her HCT has dropped from 31.8 at admission but stabilized around 26. Possibly dilutional component, occult losses due to VWD, and iron deficiency. Her stools were guaiac negative in the hospital. She should have her anemia worked up as an outpatient. . #) VWD, followed by Dr. \u001b[1m[**First Name (STitle) **]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Name (STitle) 68354**]\u001b[0m (hematologist). It is unclear why her INR and PT are elevated, as they should not be affected by pure VWD. She may be Vit K deficient or has a mixed coagulopathy that involves the vitamin K factors as well. No active issues during this inpatient stay. . #) Diabetes. During this hospitalization, she had 8 straight days of normal blood sugars. Her finger sticks and sliding scale were discontinued.

      "TEXT: #. Respiratory Distress Patient was admitted to the MICU in moderate respiratory distress with accessory muscle use, tachypnea, and audible wheezing. The etiology of the patient's respiratory distress was not initially clear although thought most likely to represent decompensated CHF given patient's history of flash pulmonary edeam and recent cessation of cardiac meds on admission. It was noted additionally upon transfer that the patient had a chest film performed at her nursing facility which revealed bibasilar infiltrates and sputum cultures which were positive for MRSA. Failing Bactrim therapy the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and was initially started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for potential nosocomial pneumonia. Upon transfer to the MICU, given the patient had sputum cultures positive for MRSA at the NH, the patient's therapy was tailored to Vancomycin only, dosed by levels with intentions to broaden coverage for gram negatives if the patient spikes a new temp, develops new consolidation or infiltrate or fails Vanco therapy. Repeat sputum cultures have not been obtained to date as the patient has not been able to expectorate any samples. The patient has remained afebrile but has developed a leukocytosis since admission, as high as 19.3 with 3% bands, now trending downward. With regards to her cardiac disease the patient is known by recent echocardiography as well as cardiac cath to have arelatively preserved EF (50%) with moderate diastolic dysfunction and possible restrictive cardiomyopathy. The patient was restarted initially on isordil and Hydralazine for preload and afterload reduction as well as Amlodipine for additional blood pressure control. Losartan has continued to be held as it is the most likely \u001b[1m[**Doctor Last Name 360**]\u001b[0m contributing to patient's ARF. The patient has since been transitioned to isordil, Hydralazine and metoprolol for additional rate control in setting of atrial tachycardia (see below) as well as history of CAD with intentions to maximize beta blockade and titrating Hydral and isordil as needed for additional BP control. The patient has been undergoing diuresis as well with net negative fluid balance since admission to the MICU. The patient additionally on transfer was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions with a large right sided effusion, likely secondary to decompensated CHF. Given the size of the effusion and the patient's respiratory distress on admission, the decision was made to perform a right thoracentesis to drain the effusion and reduce any mechanical disadvantage secondary to the effusion. The patient underwent a successful thoracentesis with drainage of 600cc of fluid. Chemistry and microanalysis revealed the effusion to be non-purulent, therefore less concerning for a parapneumonic effusion. By light's criteria the protein level in the effusion was > 3 and therefore possible consistent with an exudate. However, as the LDH was not elevated it was thought that the effusion was more likely a pseudoexudate in the setting of diuresis and chronic CHF. With treatment as above, the patient initially had decreased\\oxygen requirements titrating down from 6L facemask on admission to 2-3L NC currently, not requiring non-invasive ventilation during her admission. Given her apparent improvement, the patient was transferred to the floor but returned to the MICU shortly for repeat hypoxia, respiratory distress and was managed effectively with non-invasive mask ventilation with bi-PAP. The patient was stable over a couple of days with regards to her respiratory status, although she did not significantly improve. The patient was noted to have reaccumulation of her right pleural effusion. Given this, facial skin brakedown from the bi-PAP mask and anticipation of upcoming procedures, the patient was semi-electively intubated. The patient then underwent repeat thoracentesis, again conistent with a sterile uncomplicated transudate. She continued to require ventillatory support and had a tracheostomy tube placed on [**2161-12-30**]. She was repeatedly weaned down to lower levels of pressure support, but was repeatedly returned to prior levels secondary to tachypnea.  She had the right pleural effusion tapped again and was found again to be a transudate.  Her vent settings at discharge were PS 10, PEEP 5 with tidal volumes ~300 on 40% FiO2. * #. Rhythym - The patient on admission carried a diagnosis of afib with history of junctional arrythymias. On admission to the MICU, the patient appeared to be in a junctional rhythym. After admission to the MICU the patient developed an atrial arrythymia that appeared most consistent with afib/aflutter with occasional pauses and junctional escape beats. The patient developed this tachycardia in the setting of diuresis of 2L of fluid, although it is unknown if there is any relationship between the development of this rhythym and any of the treatments to date. The patient was noted to have associated hypertension rather than hypotension during these episodes and the patient did not develop any respiratory decompensation. The patient was given 5mg lopressor and was noted to develop some sinus pauses with junctional escape, although pauses were less than 3 seconds and the patient was asymptomatic. EP was consulted and recommended that there was no indication for pacing currently, but recommended optimizing rate control with beta blockade with titration of other meds for blood pressure control after beta blockade was first maximized. The patient was therefore started on metoprolol 25mg po bid with plans to tirate up as tolerated and has additionally been receiving hydralazine and isordil for improved blood pressure control. EP remarked that there was no indication for amiodarone and further remarked that as her pulmonary status improved, it would be expected that her atrial irritability also should improve. It was additionally suggested that anticoagulation should be considered given her atrial arrythmia. Currently, the patient is receiving SC Heparin tid but whether or not to anticoagulate indefinitely will need to be addressed. Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient was noted to have occasional bradycardia with some pauses and junctional escapes, all concerning for sick sinus. The patient's cardiac regimen with regards to her arryhtmyia as well as hypertension/diastolic dysfunction was adjusted to metoprolol 6.25mg mg PO q8hr for rate control as well as hydralazine PO and clonidine patch for afterload reduction as well as a nitrate drip for preload reduction with intention to transition back to PO isordil after stabilization. She had intermittant episodes of atrial fibrillation, often during periods of large fluid shifts, which were responsive to IV lopressor. Additionally, she had episodes of bradycardia/junctional rhythms to the 30's during which she was hemodynamically stable. She was put back on metoprolol 12.5mg with three times a day dosing with good effect. . #. Hypertension: The patient's outpatient regimen for BP control includes isordil, amlodipine, hydralazine, and losartan. As described above, the patient's losartan has been held in the setting of ARF and the patient's regimen has been changed to metoprolol, isordil and hydralazine for the indications above. Of note, given the patient's resistant hypertension requiring many agents as well as potential ARF in setting of Losartan it was suggested that the patient may have renal vascular disease driving her hypertension. Indeed the patient had a renal ultraosund with doppler which demonstrated right renal artery stenosis. The patient underwent angiography by IR which demonstrated high grade stenosis of the left renal artery but with normal perfusion and moderate stenosis of the right renal artery which previously had been demonstrated to be atrophic with flow studies indicative of significant stenosis. Because over the course of her stay the patient developed renal failure, likely secondary to episodes of moderate hypotension as well as contrast nephropathy from above studies, the patient was allowed to maintain relative hypertension with systolics in the 140 to 160 range to encourage renal perfusion.  Her BP was controlled with hydralyzine and isordil at discharge. . #. ARF: On admission the patient was noted to have a Creatinine of 3.4 which is a bump from her baseline (most recent baseline 1.2 in [**2161-7-31**]). Over the course of her MICU stay the patient's creatinine has been decreasing by holding her losartan and allowing higher perfusion pressures. All medications have been renally dosed as appropriate. The patient had a UA/Used that was bland and not consistent with infection. The patient has been undergoing effective diuresis for her CHF as above, and her creatinine continues to decrease even in the setting of diuresis. Her renal function improved over the stay, with good urine output at SBP 140-160. She was found to have Renal Artery Stenosis which was too diffuse to intervene.  Creatinine returned to baseline prior to discharge. * #. CAD:  The patient has known CAD with bare metal stent placement in [**Month (only) **] to OM #1. On admission the patient had a troponin of .08, but a normal CK-MB which likely represented mild demand ischemia in the setting of pulmonary edema with ARF. The patient was continued on her outpatient regimen of atorvastatin and plavix. Her son \u001b[1m[**Name (NI) 382**]\u001b[0m was asked why the patient was not additionally on aspirin and team was told because of history of epistaxis. Metoprolol was restarted at lower doses given more frequently given her history of eposodes of severe bradycardia. Aspirin was restarted given history of recent stenting. * #. Hypothyroidism - the patient was continued on her outpatient regimen of levothyroxine . #. Psych - The patient throughout her MICU stay has been noted to have waxing and \u001b[1m[**Doctor Last Name 688**]\u001b[0m mental status and mild paranoia consistent with delerium. The patient has been receiving Zyprexa PRN at night with decent effect. The patient has a room with windows to provide normal circadian rhythym, attempts have been made to orient the patient often to where she is, and treatment has been ongoing towards the underlying medical conditions that may additionally been exacerbating her delerium.  Her agitation improved with treatment of her infections. . # CVA: She was found to have a subacute right occipital infarct, found on head CT after unresponsiveness while being weaned off of sedation after her tracheostomy. Sge was started on ASA. . # Ventilator Associated PNA: she was treated for MRSA VAP with vanco. Bronchoalveolar lavage results from [**1-16**] showed enterobacter cloacae, see sensitivities in results section. Patient is currently afebrile, no elevation in WBC, no change in sputum.  Not thought to be a true pathogen given negative gram stain, likely colonization, but if patient develops a fever and signs/symptoms for pneumonia, would start empiric treatment for enterobacter based on these sensitivities. . # Enteroccocal Bacteremia: she was treated with ampicillin for blood cultures (1 of 4 bottles) growing ampicillin sensitive encterococcus feacales. . # Pancreatic Mass: Seen on CT scans of abdomen on [**1-5**] and [**1-11**].  Ddx included malingancy vs. fat vs. cyst.  Patient has history of pancreatitis in [**2161-1-31**] making pancreatic cyst the most likely the etiology.

She completed course of flagyl and is currently on Day [**10-14**] of PO vancomycin. . #. CHF: She has a h/o Diastolic dysfunction. Echo showed moderate AR with preserved EF >55%. She did require diuresis with lasix throughout her stay and responded well to 80 mg IV, which was further enhanced with the administration of metolazone thirty minutes beforehand.  She was discharged on daily laisx and mitolazone for goal of continued diuresis. These diuretics should be reevaluated daily as to whether the patient requires diuresis for that day. . #. Anemia: Work up consistent with ACD and iron deficiency . #. Ppx: She was anticoagulated with coumadin, PPI, Bowel regimen  * #.

      "TEXT: 86 yo M with CAD, systolic HF (EF 30%), h/o CVA ([**2187**]), HTN, recurrent [**Year (4 digits) **], admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**] to ICU on [**2199-8-23**] with hypoxia, hypotension, apparent bilateral pneumonia (likely [**Date Range **]), and acute renal failure. Per [**Hospital1 1501**] report, was feeling increasing dyspnea, malaise on [**8-23**]. CXR performed at [**Hospital3 **] was concerning for bilateral PNA.  He was given levofloxacin and metronidazole and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].    In the ED, he was hypotensive (85/44), hypoxic (91% NRB). He received Vancomycin and was admitted to the \u001b[1m[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\u001b[0m. In the ICU, his blood pressure remained stable in the low 100s systolic and O2 sats in low 90s on 3L NC. He was continued on vancomycin and levofloxacin and cefepime was added on the afternoon of [**8-23**] to cover for hospital acquired pathogens. A bedside swallowing study by his nurse \u001b[1m[**First Name (Titles) 7837**]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Last Name (Titles) **]\u001b[0m of apple sauce as well as his own secretions. He was made NPO. ICU course also significant for elevated troponin suggesting demand cardiac ischemia. . # Sepsis due to \u001b[1m[**Last Name (Titles) **]\u001b[0m PNA: PNA was felt unlikely to be due to MRSA so vancomycin was stopped upon transfer out of the ICU. Levofloxacin and metronidazole were continued via parenteral route as he was not taking oral medications consistently. Formal swallowing eval by Speech Therapy on [**2199-8-26**] showed gross [**Date Range **] of all consistencies.  He appeared to have another [**Date Range **] event on [**2199-8-26**], with increase in supplemental oxygen requirement and CXR showing worsening bibasilar opacities.  He remained NPO and completed a course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl IV on [**2199-8-31**].  His clinical status improved to the point he was not requiring supplemental oxygen by [**2199-8-30**] and appeared comfortable at rest. . #Recurrent [**Month/Day/Year **]:  Initial swallow evaluation done on [**2199-8-26**] showed gross [**Date Range **] of all consistencies.  He was placed NPO and a family meeting (discussed below) was held on [**2199-8-28**].  Due to prolonged NPO status the patient was started on TPN for nutrional support for 4 days prior to re-evaluating swallow.  His repeat swallow evaluation on [**2199-8-30**] showed persistent risk of [**Date Range **], which was discussed with his guardian by phone communication.  However, pt is at risk of [**Date Range **] even while being NPO due to continued [**Date Range **] from oral secretions and this is known to be a chronic condition, unlikely to improve.  Knowing these risks, after discussion with guardian, patient was started on pureed solids and continued on strict [**Date Range **] precautions as deliniated by Speech Therapy with the goal of transferring back to NH.  He tolerated pureed solids for 2 days without respiratory decompensation and will be discharged with the following recommendations:    a) PO diet: pureed solids, nectar thick liquids    b) PO meds crushed in puree    c) Strict [**Date Range **] precautions    d) Continue Q4 oral care including oral care just prior to any PO intake. . # Hypotension: Improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Home BP meds (metoprolol, furosemide) were held in the ICU. On [**8-24**] his SBP was in the 130s, so metoprolol was restarted, nitrol patch was added instead of the prior Imdur(erratic PO intake)and metoprolol dose was changed to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  His BP remained controlled during his stay on this dosing. . # Acute on chronic renal failure: His initial creatinine was elevated to 2.1 (baseline ~1.2), improved with IVF resuscitation. Creatinine at discharge was 0.8. . # Known CAD with elevated troponin - likely demand cardiac ischemia. Continued plavix. Allergic to aspirin. Statin was held due to his dysphagia/[**Hospital1 **], this was be restarted at NH if felt indicated by PCP. \u001b[1m[**Name10 (NameIs) **]\u001b[0m beta blocker and long-acting nitrate. . # Systolic Congestive Heart Failure, chronic: TTE in the ICU showed an EF 30%.   Held furosemide in house, as he was essentially NPO and getting IV fluids before initiation of TPN. Daily weights were monitored and should continue to be monitored in NH as lasix has not been restarted due to decreased po intake.  Pt remained euvolemic off Lasix during admission. . # While NPO,  colchicine, Cyanocobalamin, vitamin D were all held. These have not been restarted to simplify regimen and will be at the discretion of PCP whether to restart. . # Goals of care: family meeting was held on [**2199-8-28**].  In attendance were Mr. \u001b[1m[**Known lastname 7838**]\u001b[0m wife and son, his legal guardian (\u001b[1m[**Name (NI) **]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Name (NI) 1005**]\u001b[0m), attending physician at the time (Dr. \u001b[1m[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\u001b[0m), and representatives from Social Work (\u001b[1m[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7839**]\u001b[0m), Speech Therapy (\u001b[1m[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\u001b[0m), and Nutrition (\u001b[1m[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7840**]\u001b[0m). Discussed Mr. \u001b[1m[**Known lastname 7838**]\u001b[0m current status, and in particular his high risk for \u001b[1m[**Known lastname **]\u001b[0m.  Agreements between Mr. \u001b[1m[**Known lastname 7838**]\u001b[0m wife and son and other providers at the meeting (to be acted upon by his legal guardian) included:  -No PEG tube -Start TPN -NPO -Repeat evaluation by Speech Therapy on Friday [**8-30**] -Further recommendations and discussion about oral feeding to occur after evaluation on Friday [**8-30**] -Criteria for discharge to [**Hospital3 2558**] or another skilled nursing facility would include: requirement for little to no supplemental oxygen, plan for nutrition, and plan for action if he develops respiratory distress or failure -Would be OK for re-hospitalization -Code status now DNR-DNI  -After repeat evaluation ([**2199-8-30**]) with no major improvement in swallowing, it was felt pt will not improve and will have chronic [**Month/Day/Year **].  Since no expected improvement, TPN was weaned and pt was restarted on pureed solids after discussing with guardian following above recommendations for [**Month/Day/Year **] precautions.  \n",

Pt followed closely by neurosurgery during his course. Bleed remained stable on serial CT scans. Mental status improved considerably over course of hospitalization. He continues to have diminished strength in RUE which we have attributed to effect of L SDH. He had an MRI brain to rule out stroke and this confirmed no ischmeia. Plan is for pt to remain on Keppra for sz PPX until his outpt neurosurgery f/u which should be scheduled the week of [**12-15**] (he should have a Head CT prior to that visit). . # R Orbital Fx: Pt has right lateral wall orbital fracture extending to orbital wall.

Pt seen by opthalmology who did not find any visual deficits. Pt should have a complete opthalmologic exam as an outpt, which will need to be scheduled. He will also need plastic surgery follow up 2 weeks after discharge.  # Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**11-11**] for respiratory failure in setting of being unable to manage oral secretions. He was extubated [**11-14**] and soon after reintubated again for inability to manage copious oral secretions. Pt failed multiple spontaneous breathing trials, likely related to lack of gag reflex and copious oral secretions. He required tracheostomy placement and gastric tube placement on [**11-23**]. He tolerated trach mask well but continued to have secretions. . # ETOH Withdrawl: Pt required Valium CIWA scale during initial part of hospitalization. Pt should be counseled regarding options for an outpt ETOH detox program. . # Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Pt growing pseudomonas from his sputum that was pan sensitive.  He was treated initially with merepenem on [**11-20**] prior to sensitivities and then switched to Cipro and Vanc on [**11-23**], and completed antibiotics.  \n",

      "TEXT: The patient was admited to the MICU at first, where she was somnolent initially, thought to be from the Xanax coingestion. Eventually she became more arousable, quickly becoming alert and oriented.  The patient had a right upper quadarent ultrasound which was normal, and here LFTs and acetaminophen level were trended while IV n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) was given. After the 21 hours of NAC administration, the patient had an undetectable acetaminophen level and was transfered from the MICU to the floor.  The patient had no chief complaints of abdominal pain, headache, new weakness or paresthesias, and had a normal neuro exam upon re-evaluation on [**9-10**]. On the floor, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with a stable neuro exam. Her liver function tests were trended and continued to fall with a total bilirubin of 0.9 (after a peak of 2.5). She denied suicidal ideation through her admission on the medicine floor, though she reports feeling anxious. The patient was with a 1:1 sitter through her MICU course and floor admission. . TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUE: - history of hypothyroidism. TSH during the admission was within normal limits. Patient was not taking levothyroxine for months prior to this admission. She will need to re-establish care with a primary care physician for \u001b[1m[**Name9 (PRE) 702**]\u001b[0m of hypothyroidism. Patient does not need to currently start levothyroxine therapy.  *On her labs prior to discharge ([**2159-9-10**]), values showed a moderately hemolyzed specimen, leading to an erroneous elevation in her potassium to 5.2, and her LDH to a value of 482.  Medical team felt very comfortable with these values being due to lab error rather than true values.  No further laboratory follow up is necessary. . *Early in the morning of [**2159-9-10**], patient was given 1 liter of normal saline at a rate of 100cc's/hour. Patient had good oral intake through her admission on the medicine service. The fluids were continued as carry over from the patient's MICU course.  \n",

She reports progressive dyspnea on exertion and now dyspnea at rest over the last 2 days. She is now unable to walk across the room without becoming SOB. She has also had a chronic cough for the last thirty years that is usually non-productive but has become productive of thick yellow sputum over the last 2 days. Denies hemoptysis. Denies fevers or chills at home. She denies CP, N/V, dysuria, urgency, frequency, HA, neck stiffness. No sick contacts. She received the influenza vaccine this year. She endorses a 10lb unintentional weight loss over the last month [**1-25**] poor appetite. She also endorses severe back pain that has been progressive over the last 3-4 weeks and was initially intermittent but is now constant. The pain is pleuritic in nature. She denies a h/o falls or trauma to the back. She has had back pain in the past but nothing similar to this. She denies other bony pain besides in the back. She endorses night sweats for the last ten days or so. She also has intermittent colitis flares, and has had one recently with no abdominal pain but [**3-28**] watery or loose BMs/day. She denies melena or hematochezia. She underwent colonoscopy in [**2169-4-23**] and reports that polyps removed had no evidence of cancer on pathology. . Regarding the patient's RLL mass, it was incidentally discovered on a CXR in [**2169-7-24**] after her chronic cough of 30 years intensified this summer. Her outside pulmonologist recommended CT scan and on CT there was a peripherally located, broad based RLL lesion. She was prescribed Augmentin but was only able to complete 3 days [**1-25**] GI upset. Repeat CT scan 1 month later was unchanged and decision was made to seek further investigation at [**Hospital1 18**].  On [**2169-10-25**] she underwent flexible bronchoscopy by IP service with normal airway surveillance. \"Radial EBUS via the R basilar posterior segment showed a mass at 4cm from entrance from such subsegment\". Brushings and washings were taken and BAL was done. She reports her cough has been worse since her bronchoscopy. Initial pathology on brushings/washings were positive for malignancy but after review this was equivocal and it was recommended to obtain more tissue. She was seen by Dr. \u001b[1m[**Last Name (STitle) **]\u001b[0m in thoracic surgery on [**11-7**] who recommended CT-guided core needly biopsy which was to be done on [**2169-11-20**]. .

CXR showed RLL infiltrate consistent with pnemonia. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with non specific ST changes anteriorly. Labs notable for WBC 22.9 with 88%N and 7% bands, Hct 33.5 (most recent 36), BUN 32, Cr 1.3, Mg 1.3, Phos 2.4, trop neg x1. Blood cultures and sputum culture was drawn and Foley was placed. Patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn. She was given codeine and benzonatate for cough, Tylenol 1 gram for fever, Mag sulfate for repletion, hydrocortisone 50mg given known chronic prednisone use. Initial lactate was 5.5, she was given 5L NS, repeat lactate 2.5 with subjective improvement in symptoms. She was seen by thoracic surgery who recommended MICU admission and they will follow along. VS at transfer: 99.4 94 109/50 16 97% 4L NC. . Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports feeling much better overall since presentation.

CXR showed a RLL PNA. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was HD stable although was saturating 94% on 2L. Lactate noted to be 5.5 which improved following ~5L of IVF. CTA was performed that showed rapid interval progression of a consolidative process involving the right lower lobe and posterior aspect of the right upper lobe. Started on vanc zosyn and admitted to the MICU for further management. In the MICU the patient remained hemodynamically stable although continued to spike fevers up to 102.1. Transferred to the floor on HOD #1. On the floor the patient was intermittently febrile although continued to subjective improve. Continued on cefepime/vancomycin/azithro. Pulmonary and interventional pulmonary consulted.  An ultrasound of the lung showed no fluid amenable to thoracentesis. A PICC line was placed for continued antibiotic therapy on [**2169-11-22**] and an xray showed good line placement. Also revealed significant interval improvement in the pleural effusion. There was some concern that her fevers were related to her antibiotics and her antibiotics were ultimately switched to meropenem from vancomycin/cefepime.  The patient continued to have fevers on the day of discharge although frequency and severity were markedly improved. She clinically appeared well, was breathing comfortably on room air, subjectively better and lung sounds markedly improved.  One urine legionella was sent at the time of discharge and will be followed by ID.  Her last dose of meropenem will be on [**2169-12-2**]. . # ?Lung Malignancy: BAL brushings from [**10/2169**] were suspicious for adenocarcinoma although definitive biopsy deferred while patient was hospitalized. The patient will follow-up with thoracic surgery for further evaluation and likely biopsy. . # Anemia: The patient has a chronic anemia with hematocrit baseline ~36. Iron studies during this admission are c/w anemia of chronic disease. Throughout the patient's stay here her hct has been ~30. Acute on chronic anemia thought to be a combination of repeated blood draws and immunosupression for underlying malignancy and infection. Reitc count of 0.4 is supportive of this. No e/o hemolysis or active bleeding.  There was some concern for medication induced marrow suppression and her cefepime was changed to meropenem.  With this change in her meds, her anemia stabilized.  She did require 1 unit of pRBC while on cefepime. . # RA/CREST: Chronic, on low dose prednisone. Managed by Dr. \u001b[1m[**Last Name (STitle) 3057**]\u001b[0m. Prednisone was initially held in-house although re-started on transfer to the floor. Hydroxychloroquine held during active infection although will re-start after discharge. Methotrexate on Saturday per home dosing. . # HTN: Held diltiazem initially although will restart on discharge. . # Chronic rhinitis: Stable. Continued home fluticasone.  # Incidental findings: 11-mm thyroid isthmus nodule. Comparison with prior ultrasound examinations or a non-emergent ultrasound evaluation is recommended when  clinical stable.  # Transitional Issues: 1) Continue meropenem for 8 additional days to complete 10 day treatment course (last day [**2169-12-7**]) 2) Will need to re-address need for lung biopsy at upcomming thoracic surgery visit 3) F/u thoracic nodule as above 4) Repeat CBC at PCP appointment which should be within 1 week of discharge from rehab  \n",

      "TEXT:  Mr. \u001b[1m[**Known lastname 25731**]\u001b[0m was admitted to the Cardiothoracic Surgical Intensive Care Unit on [**2191-12-10**] where he was started on Lopressor, aspirin, and a heparin drip.  The patient did well during the subsequent two days with no issues.  On [**12-12**], the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times four under general endotracheal intubation.  Please refer to the dictated Operative Note for full details of this procedure. In summary, the patient had a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery graft as well as saphenous vein grafts to the posterior descending artery and obtuse marginal arteries.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and following surgery was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At this time, he was being A-paced at a rate of 74 beats per minute and came to the Intensive Care Unit on a Neo-Synephrine drip as well as a propofol drip.  He did well overnight with Neo-Synephrine being titrated to maintain a systolic blood pressure of greater than 140.  He required continued use of propofol for sedation, but did appropriately follow commands.  On postoperative day one, he did require 4 liters of lactated Ringer's, 500 cc of Hespan as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells for labile blood pressures.  He was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip at that time.  He was extubated later on postoperative day one which he tolerated without incident. At this time, he continued to have moderate amounts of serosanguineous drainage from his chest tubes as well as an air leak.  He was able to maintain his blood pressure and heart rate without being paced, and a slow wean of his Neo-Synephrine drip was begun.  Later on postoperative day two, Mr. \u001b[1m[**Known lastname 25731**]\u001b[0m went into a rate atrial fibrillation with a heart rate up into the 130s. He was given intravenous Lopressor as well as intravenous magnesium and amiodarone.  His Neo-Synephrine drip, which had been weaned off, was subsequently restarted.  At this time, he was rate controlled with a heart rate in the low 100s and in atrial fibrillation.  However, shortly thereafter, he converted back into a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 70s, and he remained there throughout the rest of the shift.  He did require a small amount of Neo-Synephrine to maintain his systolic blood pressure above 100.  It was noted early on postoperative day three that he no longer had an air leak from his chest tubes.  Later on postoperative day three, the patient's arterial line and chest tubes were removed.  He was out of bed to the chair for the first time, and he subsequently ambulated with assistance.  He remained in a normal sinus rhythm throughout that day.  On postoperative day four, the patient was deemed ready and stable for transfer to the regular floor.  The patient continued to do quite well after arrival to the floor.  He remained in almost sinus rhythm with no further episodes of ectopy.  He did quite well working with physical therapy, ambulating multiple times a day with assistance.  On postoperative day number ten, it was felt that the patient was stable and ready for discharge from the hospital.  He was doing extremely well from a cardiopulmonary standpoint.  It was, however, felt in conjunction with physical therapy, that the patient would benefit from and require a short stay at a rehabilitation facility to help further build increased strength and mobility.  At the time of discharge, he was afebrile with a heart rate of 80, in sinus rhythm, and a blood pressure of 90/60, with a room air oxygen saturation of 92%.  He was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  He moved all extremities and followed commands.  His heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, and no murmurs.  His sternum was stable, and his sternal incision was healing nicely with no erythema or drainage.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, with no hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.  He continued to have approximately 1+ lower extremity and pedal edema, for which he was continuing to be diuresed.  \n",

For surgical details, please see operative note. Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was exubated without incident. He was seen by Opthalmalogy for right corneal abrasion(unknown etiology) and was started on Polysporin eye drops. Experienced rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two and was started on Amiodarone. Beta blockade was advanced for rate control. Given persistent atrial fibrillation, he was eventually started on Warfarin. He remained fluid overloaded, requiring aggressive pulmonary toilet and diuresis. He gradually improved and eventually transferred to the SDU on postoperative day five. However due to a supratherapeutic prothrombin time(greater than 8.0), he returned to the CVICU for closer monitoring. He received six units of fresh frozen plasma. Additionally, creatinine rose to 2.3mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury. Urine output remained adequate and creatinine would gradually trend down.  Vitals remained stable without signs of cardiac tamponade.  Postoperative echocardiogram revealed showed normal biventricular cavity size with good systolic function, and no pericardial effusion. He eventually returned to the step down unit. Renal function continued to improve. Warfarin continued to be held and prothrombin time improved. INR was 2.0 on [**2104-12-7**] and he had received 2.5 mg coumadin. Prior to today he had been receiving one mg of coumadin.  He developed diarrhea which delayed discharge.C-diff was negative x3 but he was trated w/ flagyl. Loose stools resolved and flagyl was d/c'd.  He developed a left forearm phlebtis which was trated w/ IV cefazolin and was changed to po keflex on day of discharge. Phlebitis has resloved. he has a small amount of erythema from his left saphenous vein gradft harvest site and it is weeping serous drainage due to lower extremity edema. The incision edges are yellow fibrinous tissue. He will continue on keflex x 5 days to complete a 10 day course. He will also require ongoing diuresis until his lower extremity resolves.

A TTE showed normal EF and a very small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade. A CTA was negative for PE and only showed small bilateral atelectasis and the known goiter. Tox screens were negative. A head CT showed global loss of \u001b[1m[**Doctor Last Name 352**]\u001b[0m-white differentiation, which was concerning for edema related to ischemia. The patient was started on mannitol. EEG showed frequent discharges c/w either non-convlusive status or periodic epileptiform discharges with suppression pattern.

Per his wife one week prior to admission he was falling/syncopizing at home and was also experiencing a fine tremor.  Per his wife when he had these episodes she saw him just fall with no prodrome, and hit his head on one occasion with a brief loss of consciousness.  His family also noted that he was having difficulty with confusion over the past 2-3 months, with worsening short term memory.  His wife also noted a shuffling gait, resting tremor and recently was found pouring milk into soup on the stove and kept pouring until the milk overflowed. With these symptoms his wife brought him to his PCP for evaluation, at that appointment he was noted to be confused, hypotensive to the 70's, not oriented to the day and then had a syncopal episode so his PCP referred him to the ER for evaluation of his altered mental status and for further work up prior to his hip replacement.  In the ER at the OSH his vital signs had stabilized, his he said that he remembered falling but otherwise felt well.  Denied any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea.  He was then admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] for a syncope work up. . During his hospital stay he was seen by neurology and cardiology for further evaluation of his syncope and mental status changes.  He was seen by psychiatry, neurology and cardiology in consultation.  Given the report of hs shuffling gait, and cognitive decline there was concern about early Parkinson's though he had no cogwheeling or rigidity on exam.  For further evaluation it was felt that he should undergo an MRI/MRA of his head, prior to these studies he received ativan for sedation. The ativan caused a paradoxical reaction and he became extremely agitated.  At that time he was given large amounts of haldol, a total of 17mg and required 4 point leather restraints and an eventual transfer to the ICU.  In the ICU after receiving the large amounts of sedating medications he became apneic and was intubated.  He had an EEG which showed diffuse slowing, there was also concern for a possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome vs. serotonin syndrome given his rigidity so he was given 1 dose of dantrolene, there was also concern about OSA and the need for CPAP, however they had difficulty weaning sedation.  On the day of transfer he became febrile, in the setting of his AMS there was concern about possible meningitis vs. encephalitis so an LP was done.  The LP showed 1WBC (100%lymphs), 1RBC, glucose of 76, protein of 99, Gram stain and culture pending at the time of transfer.  With his multiple problems and difficulty weaning sedation he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. . On the floor, his initial VS were: 101.6, 72, 147/63, 20, 97% on CMV 500x14, PEEP of 5, 40% FiO2.  \n",

He recovered from his VAP and is mental status improved by the time of discharge.  #) Altered Mental Status: initial cause is unclear, however given wife's report and documentation from the OSH there was concern for early onset Parkinson's and possible \u001b[1m[**Last Name (un) 309**]\u001b[0m Body Dementia, additionally his paradoxical reaction to ativan is concerning for an underlying dementia.  CSF was negative for signs of infection.  MRI was also negative for any acute intracranial process. Neurology was consulted and felt that his mental status changes were secondary to receiving benzodiazapines in the substrate of \u001b[1m[**Last Name (un) 309**]\u001b[0m Body Dementia.  He was sedated on propofol while intubated, and switched to presedex around the time of extubation.  Also while intubated, required several doses of seroquel for agitation.  Once extubated, patient was oriented to only person, and after speaking with family, seemed to be at baseline.  His confusioin became severe 24 hours later, with difficult to control agitation.  Recevied quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, haldol, trazodone with no improvement of agitation.  Required placement back on Precedex gtt for sedation.  Sent to floors with readmission to ICU for acute agitation.  Required Precedex gtt again for control of acute agitation.  Removed all antipsychotics.  Weaned off Precedex.  Return to nonagitated, pleasant state within 36 hours of ICU admission.  Had EEG that was non-suggestive of seizure. He will need full neurpsych and cognitive testing once his acute delerium resolves.  Continued on lamotrigine, which may need uptitration.  Seroquel for agitation has been suggested although not required for last 24 hours of admission.  #) Respiratory Failure: Patient initially intubated at OSH for altered mental status in the setting of recieving large amounts of haldol.  Failed extubation attempt on [**7-8**] and was reintubated.  CXR showed both pneumonia/aspiration pneumonitis and pulmonary edema. Patient was emperically started on vancomycin and zosyn. Sputum cultures grew MSSA, and patient was initially started on nafcillin, then swtiched to cefazolin after he developed drug rash.  Total course will be 7 days, Day 1 = [**7-12**]. He was eventually extubated on [**7-14**] once his mental status improved, pneumonia improved on CXR, and diuresis with IV Lasix.  He tolerated the extubation well.  #. SVT: On [**7-17**], patient flipped into SVT at 180, which resolved with carotid massage.  Likely AVRT or AVNRT.  Upon readmission to ICU, had sinus tachycardia and hypertension thought to be from agitation.  Started metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] with good control.  #. Urinary Retention: Patient on terzosin at home.  He was switched to flomax secondary to hypotension and required intermittent straight caths while in the unit.  #) Hypertension: Patient on lisinopril and metoprolol at home. While intubated, these medications were held.  SBPs > 200 when patient was agitated.  He was started on a labetolol drip and BPs improved.  Once patient's sedation was changed to presedex, labetolol gtt was weaned off.  After extubation, his home BP medications were restarted, and on transfer to the floor, he was on metoprolol and lisinopril.  #) Bipolar Disorder: While patient was intubated, he was unable to take his home lamotrigine, cymbalta and wellbutrin as currently unable to get an NG or OG tube.  Lamotrigine was restarted as above.  #Sleep Apnea: found to have episodes of apnea with desaturations into the mid to low 80's.  Will need a sleep evaluation.  \n",

      "TEXT: 60 year old woman with history of EtOH cirrhosis (complicated by ascites with SBP, esophageal varices without bleed), s/p recent colectomy and ileostomy for ischemic colitis w/ enterococcus bacteremia while on both vancomycin and linezolid who is referred from clinic for drug rash, likely secondary to linezolid. . ## Enterococcus bacteremia - When initially discovered, this was treated with rifaximin and linezolid and she consequently developed the rash days later.  Vancomycin was then started on [**10-1**], without resolution of rash.  It remains unclear if this rash represents allergy to vancomycin as well, given the fact that a drug rash time course is often variable.  She was switched to ampicillin IV Q6 hours, as the sensitivities indicated that this antibiotic choice was appropriate, and her rash continued to improve. A home IV pump was arranged by case management and she was discharged with her PICC line for home infusion of ampicillin.  An echocardiogram was done to rule out endocardititis and it did not show any vegetations.  She will need to have follow-up labs (CBC, BUN/Cr) drawn in 1 week to be sure the antibiotic is not creating any new issues that need to be addressed.  Blood cultures are still pending on discharge as well. . ## Hypokalemia - Each morning during this admission, the patient's K+ level was below the normal range, requiring supplementation with KCl.  This was likely secondary to her high ostomy output.  Even though her spironolactone was uptitrated from 25mg to 50mg just prior to admission for management of lower extremity edema, it was decided to discharge her with 20 mEq KCl supplementation daily. . ## Diarrhea - The patient developed liquidy, green stools.  C. Diff toxin was sent and negative.  Since we felt that her diarrhea was likely due to bacterial overgrowth rather than some sort of invasive bacterial infection (otherwise asymptomatic), we discharged her with Lomotil to help form her stools.  We felt that this would also help with her hypokalemia (as above). . ## Alcohol cirrhosis: Per patient, she had not had an alcoholic beverage since [**2122-6-23**]. She is currently working on [**7-1**] months sober outside of the hospital to qualify for possible liver transplant. We continued her regimen of lasix/spironolactone for ascites/lower extremity edema management. . ## History of SBP/ non-bleeding esophageal varices: Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily and nadolol was continued while she continues to be on tube feeds at home.  She did not develop any ascites or GI bleeds during the admission. . ## VNA directives: We confirmed proper placement of the feeding tube and she should continue to be on tube feeds, on the schedule she was adhering to prior to admission, per Dr. \u001b[1m[**Last Name (STitle) **]\u001b[0m.  She will also need continued ostomy and wound care. Once her IV antibiotic course has finished on [**10-16**], the PICC line may be removed. . ## Follow-up:  The patient will have the following labs drawn on [**10-13**]: CBC, K+, and BUN/Cr.  These results will be faxed to the office of Dr. \u001b[1m[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2943**]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Name (STitle) 696**]\u001b[0m, in anticipation of her follow-up appointment on [**10-14**].

The history is obtained from the chart only as the patient is Portugese speaking.  Mr. [**Known lastname 303**] was transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital **]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[**Hospital3 2063**]\u001b[0m after presenting with hematemesis on [**1-3**].  He had a first episode at 6 am on the morning of presentation, five episodes of bright red blood per mouth associated with some nausea.  He also relates some melena and two episodes of syncope at home along with persistent lightheadedness. Patient in addition, had an episode of rectal bleeding now for a few months, although he denies any abdominal pain.  Patient has a long history of alcohol abuse, but no other complications from the alcohol abuse per report.  Upon admission, the patient's hematocrit was 40.3 and his coags were normal.  The patient apparently last drank at 2 am the morning of admission.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed at outside hospital which showed severe acute and chronic esophagitis. Varices were not definitively identified, but there is a deep esophageal ulcer tear with the bleeding vessel that was treated with BiPAP and epi in the lower esophagus.  There is also bleeding vessel just below the GE junction which was injected with good hemostasis.  Three clips were placed. There was no banding of any vessels due to fibrosis.  The patient was intubated for airway protection and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells, and had a repeat hematocrit of 39.5.  He was transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 188**]\u001b[0m MICU for further management.  Initially, he was evaluated by the Thoracic Surgery Service, as it was felt he was high risk for rebleed due to his [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  However, Surgery felt that no other intervention was necessary from a surgical standpoint.  At that point, he was then transferred to the MICU for potential alcohol withdrawal and further management of his gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was changed to CPAP with pressure support the day following admission.  \n",

Sodium was 137, potassium of 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 24, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, and sugar 141.  His albumin was 4.2, his AST was 73, ALT was 59, alkaline phosphatase was 79, T bilirubin 0.8, CK was 143, lipase 21, amylase 19.  His PT was 13.0, PTT is 24.8, and INR is 1.1.

      "TEXT: 1. Gastrointestinal:  The patient had this acute large volume of hematemesis at the outside hospital with the esophagogastroduodenoscopy done at the outside hospital with the intervention previously mentioned.  Since his arrival at \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 69**]\u001b[0m, he has had no further incidences of active bleeding and his hematocrit has remained stable at 35.3 the day of discharge.  He has had no further symptoms of lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath.  He was placed on Protonix 40 mg \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 **]\u001b[0m, but received no additional transfusions at \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 188**]\u001b[0m.  He was seen by the Thoracic Surgery team prior to discharge, who cleared him without any further intervention necessary for the [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  Of note, he had normal LFTs and normal coags despite his history of alcohol abuse.  2. Infectious Disease:  During the patient's stay in the MICU, he was weaned from the ventilator with some difficulty and he was found to have copious secretions that were green in color, to have spiked a fever, growing Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative rods in the sputum.  He was initially covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl which after one day was changed to levofloxacin and clindamycin.  He subsequently was afebrile and he had a good oxygen saturations without any shortness of breath.  He was continued on the levofloxacin and the clindamycin until the day of discharge when he was discharged on a 10 day course of levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis from the esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  3. EtOH abuse:  The patient has a 20+ year history of alcohol abuse drinking roughly 1 liter of alcohol per day.  During the stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he received 2 doses of Valium for agitation, but thereafter remained stable with no evidence of alcohol withdrawal.  He was continued on prn Valium, but required no additional doses.  Prior to his discharge, he was explained in Portugese by an interpreter the danger that his continued drinking opposed to his health.  In particular, he was instructed if he continues to drink, his risk of rebleed, and potentially additional bleeding episodes remain significant.  The patient indicates that he understood the risks and would refrain from further alcohol.  In addition, the patient was given daily doses of folic acid and thiamine during his hospital stay and sent home on a multivitamin on discharge.  4. Hematologic:  The patient was found to have a low platelet count on admission and it gradually rose to 145, but remained depressed.  This is possibly due to splenic sequestration and the patient's cirrhotic liver, given the increased in the platelets of the course of his hospitalization, no further workup was undertaken as there is no spontaneous active bleeding.  He should follow this up with his primary care physician.  \n",

      "TEXT:  This was a 51-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, and cirrhosis, status post gastrojejunostomy secondary to duodenal stricture with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, intermittent exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis, and osteoporosis.  The patient was admitted on [**2145-11-15**], and presented with the presumptive diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, metabolic alkalosis, sudden onset, which was thought to be secondary to decompensated liver failure.  She was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Medicine Service where she was cared for initially on the floor and evaluated by the Liver Service as well.  On [**2145-11-16**], the patient received a CT scan which demonstrated a probable small bowel obstruction.  Given her continued decompensation, it was thought to be a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, worsening .................. status.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the \u001b[1m[**Hospital Ward Name 516**]\u001b[0m.  On [**11-16**], a Surgery consult was obtained.  On review of the \u001b[1m[**Hospital 228**]\u001b[0m hospital course, it was noted that there was a question of small bowel obstruction per CT scan; however, given the patient met criteria for Child C cirrhosis, was a very poor surgical candidate.  A series of discussions were undertaken with the family as to whether or not they wished to pursue surgical correction of the small bowel obstruction.  It was decided by the family they would pursue this option, and on the evening of [**2145-11-17**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she underwent exploratory laparotomy.  At the time, it was noted that the patient had a thick adhesion upon which there was a lobulized loop of jejunum. An approximate 10 cm segment of the jejunum was resected. The patient tolerated this procedure.  She was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on the \u001b[1m[**Hospital Ward Name 516**]\u001b[0m.  Over night from [**11-17**], until the evening of [**11-18**], the patient was noted to be increasingly alkalotic despite supportive care measures by the Intensive Care Unit staff.  It was decided, with the patient becoming progressively more obtunded, her abdomen more distended, difficulties managing her blood pressure, and acid based status, to return with the patient to the Operating Room on the evening of [**2145-11-18**].  At that time, the patient underwent a second exploratory laparotomy where she was noted to have a large amount of peritoneal fluid which was evacuated by suction.  At that time, exploratory laparotomy, there was evidence of diffuse ischemic and infarctive disease of the small bowel.  At that time, it was decided to close the patient and return her to the Intensive Care Unit.  Discussions with the family where undertaken, and it was decided at that time to withdraw support and make the patient COMFORT CARE MEASURES ONLY.  The patient was taken off pressors and intravenous fluids in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  She was bolused with Dilaudid.  Approximately 45 min after withdraw of support, the patient expired. Following this, the family declined a postmortem examination.  \n",

On [**9-26**] she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 and aortic valve replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologcially intact and extubated. On post-op day one she had an episode of SVT which was cardioverted electrically and started on Amiodarone. She had her chest tubes removed and was weaned off of Neo-Synephrine. On post-op day two she was started on diuretics and beta blockers. She was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Her epicardial pacing wires were removed and she was transferred to the SDU. Also on this day she received blood transfusion for low HCT. On post-op day three she again had episode of SVT which converted to SR. She was started on Coumadin. On post-op day four pulmonary medicine consulted on Ms. [**Known lastname **] for pre-op w/u that revealed apical nodule densities. Over the next several days the patients activity level was advanced and on POD7 it was decided she was stable and ready for discharge to home with visiting nurses.  \n",

Her symptoms persisted and she was admitted to [**Location (un) 60883**]Hospital on [**2110-7-18**] for thrombophelbitis/cellulitis. She complained of nausea, vomiting, and abdomimal pain. She experienced no fevers, chills, headache, SOB, or cough.  She was started on IV Vancomycin and IV clindamycin.  Her symptoms improved though did not completely resolve.  She was switched to PO Augmentin (7 day course 875 po BID) and discharged on [**7-20**].  During her hospitalization she was also found to be anemic, with no evidence of a \"gross bleed.\"  Her anemia work-up was deferred to her PCP. . She went back to the hospital at the beginning of [**Month (only) **] because her wrist symptoms had not completely resolved.  She was given IV vancomycin and prescribed Linezolid.  She [**Month (only) 20227**]'t afford the medication and was switched to an unknown dose/course of levaquin. . Despite numerous antibiotics, she notes the persistence of mild erythema, pain, and swelling of her left wrist.  She lives in CT, and denies any recent outdoor hikes, camping, or tick bites.   She came to [**Location (un) 86**] to visit her sister whose husband was recently injured in [**Country 2451**].

She was able to sleep,but notes ongoing nausea, vomiting, and photophobia.  The migraine pain has been localized mainly on the right side, throbbing, and currently feels as if her eye is \"going to [**Doctor Last Name **] out.\"  According to the neurology note she developed R-arm heaviness a few hours after the onset of her headache. Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 36665**]'t comment when asked about this. Her symptoms persisted and on Monday she developed left upper chest and upper back pain.  She [**Last Name (Titles) 20227**]'t describe the pain further. She denied any sensory changes, motor changes, numbness or tingling.  She has no neck pain, facial droop, or slurred speech. .

The more superior opacity is the denser of the two measuring approximately 2.5 x 1.3 cm.  Just inferior to this, is a less dense more ill-defined area of spiculated opacity, measuring 1.7 x 1.4 cm.  The patient has undergone a full staging work-up with cervical mediastinoscopy, that revealed to evidence of malignancy in the nodes, a PET scan that revealed FDG avid disease only in the LUL and a head MRI that was within normal limits.  The initial plan was to have him undergo a LUL lobectomy. However, given his poor pulmonary function, thoracic surgery does not feel that he is a good candidate for resection.  Therefore, oncology was consulted to help with non-surgical management.  \n",

[**Telephone/Fax (1) 69039**]) at [**Location (un) **] Counseling Ctr.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69038**] prescribes Ritalin 60 mg daily and Seroquel 600 mg daily for the patient, which he had been taking up until just a few weeks before coming into the hospital.  It was not clear why he was taking these medications.  He says of his traumatic childhood, \"I was 6 [**1-30**] when my sister and I returned from \u001b[1m[**Hospital 1474**]\u001b[0m Hospital after having our tonsils out, and there was a surprise. My old man blew his head off. There was a trail of blood. He was cold and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] on the bed in the master bedroom.\"  He says that his childhood was rough and implied physical abuse by some, but not all members of his immediate family.  A brother reportedly broke his back and on another occasion both shoulders by holding his hands behind his back until \"he would give\" when he was 8.5 years old.  At that time he thought about suicide, but never since, by his report.  He denies nightmares, flashback or hypervigilance.  Of his \"PTSD\" he alludes to his childhood and says that sometimes he \"will see something on the boob tube that will make me freeze up.\"  The last time that he had suicidal ideation was at 8 yo.  He says, \"I don't have paranoia. ...I've never had audio or visual hallucinations.\"  He mentions a time when he would tape conversations with his sister to have a record of their exchanges, although it was not clear why he was doing this (?paranoia of some sort).  Mr. [**Known lastname 6203**] does have a h/o DMH services, at least suggesting some more chronic mental illness. .

      "TEXT: #. Respiratory Distress Patient was admitted to the MICU in moderate respiratory distress with accessory muscle use, tachypnea, and audible wheezing. The etiology of the patient's respiratory distress was not initially clear although thought most likely to represent decompensated CHF given patient's history of flash pulmonary edeam and recent cessation of cardiac meds on admission. It was noted additionally upon transfer that the patient had a chest film performed at her nursing facility which revealed bibasilar infiltrates and sputum cultures which were positive for MRSA. Failing Bactrim therapy the patient was transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m and was initially started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for potential nosocomial pneumonia. Upon transfer to the MICU, given the patient had sputum cultures positive for MRSA at the NH, the patient's therapy was tailored to Vancomycin only, dosed by levels with intentions to broaden coverage for gram negatives if the patient spikes a new temp, develops new consolidation or infiltrate or fails Vanco therapy. Repeat sputum cultures have not been obtained to date as the patient has not been able to expectorate any samples. The patient has remained afebrile but has developed a leukocytosis since admission, as high as 19.3 with 3% bands, now trending downward. With regards to her cardiac disease the patient is known by recent echocardiography as well as cardiac cath to have arelatively preserved EF (50%) with moderate diastolic dysfunction and possible restrictive cardiomyopathy. The patient was restarted initially on isordil and Hydralazine for preload and afterload reduction as well as Amlodipine for additional blood pressure control. Losartan has continued to be held as it is the most likely [**Doctor Last Name 360**] contributing to patient's ARF. The patient has since been transitioned to isordil, Hydralazine and metoprolol for additional rate control in setting of atrial tachycardia (see below) as well as history of CAD with intentions to maximize beta blockade and titrating Hydral and isordil as needed for additional BP control. The patient has been undergoing diuresis as well with net negative fluid balance since admission to the MICU. The patient additionally on transfer was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions with a large right sided effusion, likely secondary to decompensated CHF. Given the size of the effusion and the patient's respiratory distress on admission, the decision was made to perform a right thoracentesis to drain the effusion and reduce any mechanical disadvantage secondary to the effusion. The patient underwent a successful thoracentesis with drainage of 600cc of fluid. Chemistry and microanalysis revealed the effusion to be non-purulent, therefore less concerning for a parapneumonic effusion. By light's criteria the protein level in the effusion was > 3 and therefore possible consistent with an exudate. However, as the LDH was not elevated it was thought that the effusion was more likely a pseudoexudate in the setting of diuresis and chronic CHF. With treatment as above, the patient initially had decreased\\oxygen requirements titrating down from 6L facemask on admission to 2-3L NC currently, not requiring non-invasive ventilation during her admission. Given her apparent improvement, the patient was transferred to the floor but returned to the MICU shortly for repeat hypoxia, respiratory distress and was managed effectively with non-invasive mask ventilation with bi-PAP. The patient was stable over a couple of days with regards to her respiratory status, although she did not significantly improve. The patient was noted to have reaccumulation of her right pleural effusion. Given this, facial skin brakedown from the bi-PAP mask and anticipation of upcoming procedures, the patient was semi-electively intubated. The patient then underwent repeat thoracentesis, again conistent with a sterile uncomplicated transudate. She continued to require ventillatory support and had a tracheostomy tube placed on [**2161-12-30**]. She was repeatedly weaned down to lower levels of pressure support, but was repeatedly returned to prior levels secondary to tachypnea.  She had the right pleural effusion tapped again and was found again to be a transudate.  Her vent settings at discharge were PS 10, PEEP 5 with tidal volumes ~300 on 40% FiO2. * #. Rhythym - The patient on admission carried a diagnosis of afib with history of junctional arrythymias. On admission to the MICU, the patient appeared to be in a junctional rhythym. After admission to the MICU the patient developed an atrial arrythymia that appeared most consistent with afib/aflutter with occasional pauses and junctional escape beats. The patient developed this tachycardia in the setting of diuresis of 2L of fluid, although it is unknown if there is any relationship between the development of this rhythym and any of the treatments to date. The patient was noted to have associated hypertension rather than hypotension during these episodes and the patient did not develop any respiratory decompensation. The patient was given 5mg lopressor and was noted to develop some sinus pauses with junctional escape, although pauses were less than 3 seconds and the patient was asymptomatic. EP was consulted and recommended that there was no indication for pacing currently, but recommended optimizing rate control with beta blockade with titration of other meds for blood pressure control after beta blockade was first maximized. The patient was therefore started on metoprolol 25mg po bid with plans to tirate up as tolerated and has additionally been receiving hydralazine and isordil for improved blood pressure control. EP remarked that there was no indication for amiodarone and further remarked that as her pulmonary status improved, it would be expected that her atrial irritability also should improve. It was additionally suggested that anticoagulation should be considered given her atrial arrythmia. Currently, the patient is receiving SC Heparin tid but whether or not to anticoagulate indefinitely will need to be addressed. Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient was noted to have occasional bradycardia with some pauses and junctional escapes, all concerning for sick sinus. The patient's cardiac regimen with regards to her arryhtmyia as well as hypertension/diastolic dysfunction was adjusted to metoprolol 6.25mg mg PO q8hr for rate control as well as hydralazine PO and clonidine patch for afterload reduction as well as a nitrate drip for preload reduction with intention to transition back to PO isordil after stabilization. She had intermittant episodes of atrial fibrillation, often during periods of large fluid shifts, which were responsive to IV lopressor. Additionally, she had episodes of bradycardia/junctional rhythms to the 30's during which she was hemodynamically stable. She was put back on metoprolol 12.5mg with three times a day dosing with good effect. . #. Hypertension: The patient's outpatient regimen for BP control includes isordil, amlodipine, hydralazine, and losartan. As described above, the patient's losartan has been held in the setting of ARF and the patient's regimen has been changed to metoprolol, isordil and hydralazine for the indications above. Of note, given the patient's resistant hypertension requiring many agents as well as potential ARF in setting of Losartan it was suggested that the patient may have renal vascular disease driving her hypertension. Indeed the patient had a renal ultraosund with doppler which demonstrated right renal artery stenosis. The patient underwent angiography by IR which demonstrated high grade stenosis of the left renal artery but with normal perfusion and moderate stenosis of the right renal artery which previously had been demonstrated to be atrophic with flow studies indicative of significant stenosis. Because over the course of her stay the patient developed renal failure, likely secondary to episodes of moderate hypotension as well as contrast nephropathy from above studies, the patient was allowed to maintain relative hypertension with systolics in the 140 to 160 range to encourage renal perfusion.  Her BP was controlled with hydralyzine and isordil at discharge. . #. ARF: On admission the patient was noted to have a Creatinine of 3.4 which is a bump from her baseline (most recent baseline 1.2 in [**2161-7-31**]). Over the course of her MICU stay the patient's creatinine has been decreasing by holding her losartan and allowing higher perfusion pressures. All medications have been renally dosed as appropriate. The patient had a UA/Used that was bland and not consistent with infection. The patient has been undergoing effective diuresis for her CHF as above, and her creatinine continues to decrease even in the setting of diuresis. Her renal function improved over the stay, with good urine output at SBP 140-160. She was found to have Renal Artery Stenosis which was too diffuse to intervene.  Creatinine returned to baseline prior to discharge. * #. CAD:  The patient has known CAD with bare metal stent placement in [**Month (only) **] to OM #1. On admission the patient had a troponin of .08, but a normal CK-MB which likely represented mild demand ischemia in the setting of pulmonary edema with ARF. The patient was continued on her outpatient regimen of atorvastatin and plavix. Her son [**Name (NI) 382**] was asked why the patient was not additionally on aspirin and team was told because of history of epistaxis. Metoprolol was restarted at lower doses given more frequently given her history of eposodes of severe bradycardia. Aspirin was restarted given history of recent stenting. * #. Hypothyroidism - the patient was continued on her outpatient regimen of levothyroxine . #. Psych - The patient throughout her MICU stay has been noted to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and mild paranoia consistent with delerium. The patient has been receiving Zyprexa PRN at night with decent effect. The patient has a room with windows to provide normal circadian rhythym, attempts have been made to orient the patient often to where she is, and treatment has been ongoing towards the underlying medical conditions that may additionally been exacerbating her delerium.  Her agitation improved with treatment of her infections. . # CVA: She was found to have a subacute right occipital infarct, found on head CT after unresponsiveness while being weaned off of sedation after her tracheostomy. Sge was started on ASA. . # Ventilator Associated PNA: she was treated for MRSA VAP with vanco. Bronchoalveolar lavage results from [**1-16**] showed enterobacter cloacae, see sensitivities in results section. Patient is currently afebrile, no elevation in WBC, no change in sputum.  Not thought to be a true pathogen given negative gram stain, likely colonization, but if patient develops a fever and signs/symptoms for pneumonia, would start empiric treatment for enterobacter based on these sensitivities. . # Enteroccocal Bacteremia: she was treated with ampicillin for blood cultures (1 of 4 bottles) growing ampicillin sensitive encterococcus feacales. . # Pancreatic Mass: Seen on CT scans of abdomen on [**1-5**] and [**1-11**].  Ddx included malingancy vs. fat vs. cyst.  Patient has history of pancreatitis in [**2161-1-31**] making pancreatic cyst the most likely the etiology.

She completed course of flagyl and is currently on Day [**10-14**] of PO vancomycin. . #. CHF: She has a h/o Diastolic dysfunction. Echo showed moderate AR with preserved EF >55%. She did require diuresis with lasix throughout her stay and responded well to 80 mg IV, which was further enhanced with the administration of metolazone thirty minutes beforehand.  She was discharged on daily laisx and mitolazone for goal of continued diuresis. These diuretics should be reevaluated daily as to whether the patient requires diuresis for that day. . #.

Per \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 1501**]\u001b[0m report, was feeling increasing dyspnea, malaise on [**8-23**]. CXR performed at \u001b[1m[**Hospital3 **]\u001b[0m was concerning for bilateral PNA.  He was given levofloxacin and metronidazole and transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m.    In the ED, he was hypotensive (85/44), hypoxic (91% NRB). He received Vancomycin and was admitted to the \u001b[1m[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\u001b[0m. In the ICU, his blood pressure remained stable in the low 100s systolic and O2 sats in low 90s on 3L NC. He was continued on vancomycin and levofloxacin and cefepime was added on the afternoon of [**8-23**] to cover for hospital acquired pathogens. A bedside swallowing study by his nurse [**First Name (Titles) 7837**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of apple sauce as well as his own secretions. He was made NPO. ICU course also significant for elevated troponin suggesting demand cardiac ischemia. . # Sepsis due to [**Last Name (Titles) **] PNA: PNA was felt unlikely to be due to MRSA so vancomycin was stopped upon transfer out of the ICU. Levofloxacin and metronidazole were continued via parenteral route as he was not taking oral medications consistently. Formal swallowing eval by Speech Therapy on [**2199-8-26**] showed gross [**Date Range **] of all consistencies.  He appeared to have another [**Date Range **] event on [**2199-8-26**], with increase in supplemental oxygen requirement and CXR showing worsening bibasilar opacities.  He remained NPO and completed a course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl IV on [**2199-8-31**].  His clinical status improved to the point he was not requiring supplemental oxygen by [**2199-8-30**] and appeared comfortable at rest. . #Recurrent [**Month/Day/Year **]:  Initial swallow evaluation done on [**2199-8-26**] showed gross [**Date Range **] of all consistencies.  He was placed NPO and a family meeting (discussed below) was held on [**2199-8-28**].  Due to prolonged NPO status the patient was started on TPN for nutrional support for 4 days prior to re-evaluating swallow.  His repeat swallow evaluation on [**2199-8-30**] showed persistent risk of [**Date Range **], which was discussed with his guardian by phone communication.  However, pt is at risk of [**Date Range **] even while being NPO due to continued [**Date Range **] from oral secretions and this is known to be a chronic condition, unlikely to improve.  Knowing these risks, after discussion with guardian, patient was started on pureed solids and continued on strict [**Date Range **] precautions as deliniated by Speech Therapy with the goal of transferring back to NH.  He tolerated pureed solids for 2 days without respiratory decompensation and will be discharged with the following recommendations:    a) PO diet: pureed solids, nectar thick liquids    b) PO meds crushed in puree    c) Strict [**Date Range **] precautions    d) Continue Q4 oral care including oral care just prior to any PO intake. . # Hypotension: Improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Home BP meds (metoprolol, furosemide) were held in the ICU.

His BP remained controlled during his stay on this dosing. . # Acute on chronic renal failure: His initial creatinine was elevated to 2.1 (baseline ~1.2), improved with IVF resuscitation. Creatinine at discharge was 0.8. . # Known CAD with elevated troponin - likely demand cardiac ischemia. Continued plavix. Allergic to aspirin.

[**Name10 (NameIs) **] beta blocker and long-acting nitrate. . # Systolic Congestive Heart Failure, chronic: TTE in the ICU showed an EF 30%.   Held furosemide in house, as he was essentially NPO and getting IV fluids before initiation of TPN. Daily weights were monitored and should continue to be monitored in NH as lasix has not been restarted due to decreased po intake.  Pt remained euvolemic off Lasix during admission. . # While NPO,  colchicine, Cyanocobalamin, vitamin D were all held. These have not been restarted to simplify regimen and will be at the discretion of PCP whether to restart. . # Goals of care: family meeting was held on [**2199-8-28**].

      "TEXT: MICU Course In the MICU, she was intubated upon admission [**11-28**] and respiratory failure was thought to be a combination of pneumonia and volume overload.  Sputum cultures grew Moraxella, and levaquin was started.  The patient was intermittently hypotensive but did not require pressors.  She was also volume overloaded and was diuresed with IV lasix. Creatinine rose as high as 7, and she underwent 1 session of HD.  Renal failure improved thereafter.  She also had an anion gap acidosis briefly requiring insulin gtt.  Subsequently her respiratory failure improved, and she was extubated and then weaned off oxygen, breathing comfortably on room air. Blood pressure rose into the 160s, and home BP meds were restarted.   Home lantus and ISS were also restarted.  Central line was pulled.  She was transferred to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service.  Remainder of floor course summarized below by problem  #) Pneumonia: Oxygen saturations remained mid 90s on room air at rest and with ambulation.  Levaquin was continued for a total 10 day course renally dosed.  She had intermittent low-grade fevers but was afebrile x 24 hours prior to discharge with Tmax 99s.  #) CHF: EF was 20% [**2161-11-30**], no change since [**4-14**]. Initial respiratory decompensation may have been in part flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension. However, she had no further evidence of volume overload and did not require Lasix on the floor. Remained euvolemic at time of discharge.  #) Neck mass: Patient was noted to have a nontender L neck mass. CT without contrast (given her renal failure) was done, showing SCM enlargement of unclear etiology.  Follow-up US was done, showing similar findings. After discussion with her nephrologist, it was felt that this was most likely a hematoma since there was an attempted line placement at this site and the pt did not have this mass prior to line placement. It should be followed to resolution as an outpatient.  #) Hypertension: Home antihypertensive regimen was continued. SBP was 140s at time of discharge.  #) ESRD s/p xplant: Creatinine continued to improve, and urine output was high, consistent with resolving ATN.  She did not require further HD sessions. Prednisone and sirolimus were continued as well as Zemplar.  Tacrolimus was held per renal recommendations.  #) Type 1 DM: \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 **]\u001b[0m Lantus and HISS were continued per home regimen . #) Anemia: Erythropoeitin was continued at three times weekly rather than twice weekly dosing.  \n",

The patient has been admitted from and OSH ED from her nursing home for nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain and leukocytosis for the past 24 hours. She has become increasingly altered over that time.  Since [**2147-7-14**] she has been in declining health. At that time she was living at home and was admitted to an OSH for chest pain found to be coronary artery disease medically managed presumedly with anti-platelet therapy. She developed black tarry stools and was found to have a bleeding ulcer at that time. In [**2147-10-14**] she had a dyspnea admission ruled anxiety. In [**2147-12-14**] she was admitted again for vomiting and found to have a VRE UTI, L sided pneumonia with LLE cellulitis. Per her daughter, during this admission the patient had an \"upper GI obstruction,\" likely volvulus warranting surgery. However no surgery was performed. She was transferred to Country \u001b[1m[**Hospital 731**]\u001b[0m Rehab for several hours and returned with an acute MI. She was transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital 12017**]\u001b[0m Hospital for cath and had bare metal stent placed in the \"front artery.\" Upon return to rehab she was again readmitted for Pulmonary edema. This most recent stay ended [**2148-1-17**] with discharge to \u001b[1m[**Hospital 32944**]\u001b[0m Rehab.  Per the patient's daughter, the patient was vomiting and complaining of abdominal pain the night prior to presentation. The patient is alert and oriented at \u001b[1m[**Hospital 5348**]\u001b[0m but does become combative when irritated.  At the OSH ED she was somnolent but arousable and oriented. There she received Dilaudid & a benzodiazepine with IV Fluids. She was monitored on telemetry. Concern for Small Bowel Obstruction warranted Abdominal CT with PO contrast only (no sufficient IV access). That scan was reviewed by our radiologists and showed only a ventral hernia and poor penetration of contrast into her colon, not suggestive of obstruction or acute abdominal process. She was noted to have a WBC of 21 with 91% neutrophils, HCT 34.3, Cr 1.1. CK 29 with CKMB 8.6 which is elevated and tropinin I of 0.12 which is within the normal range. They treated her with 1g vancomycin for concern of shunt infection and sent her to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m for further evaluation. Of note, she has recently been on doxycycline, vanomycin and levafloxacin for M. Catarrhalis from her sputum, resistant E coli from urine and also with linezolid for VRE in the urine (per records from \u001b[1m[**Hospital 12017**]\u001b[0m Hospital).  In our ED, VS: 96.5 BP 125/79 P 118 RR 14 98% on room air. The patient received Flagyl/Zosyn for putative abdominal infection. Surgery was consulted and based on exam and review of the films, did not feel she had an acute problem nor did she warrant surgical intervention. Stable ventral hernia, easily reducible with bowel in hernia. She was admitted to medicine for elevated WBC count and evaluation of her mental status.  On arrival to the floor the patient is tachycardia and minimally responsive. She awakes to vigorous stimulation and multiple sternal rubs. She is unable to give any history or status.  \n",

CXR showed a RLL PNA. Transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m where she was HD stable although was saturating 94% on 2L. Lactate noted to be 5.5 which improved following ~5L of IVF. CTA was performed that showed rapid interval progression of a consolidative process involving the right lower lobe and posterior aspect of the right upper lobe. Started on vanc zosyn and admitted to the MICU for further management. In the MICU the patient remained hemodynamically stable although continued to spike fevers up to 102.1. Transferred to the floor on HOD #1. On the floor the patient was intermittently febrile although continued to subjective improve. Continued on cefepime/vancomycin/azithro. Pulmonary and interventional pulmonary consulted.  An ultrasound of the lung showed no fluid amenable to thoracentesis. A PICC line was placed for continued antibiotic therapy on [**2169-11-22**] and an xray showed good line placement. Also revealed significant interval improvement in the pleural effusion. There was some concern that her fevers were related to her antibiotics and her antibiotics were ultimately switched to meropenem from vancomycin/cefepime.  The patient continued to have fevers on the day of discharge although frequency and severity were markedly improved. She clinically appeared well, was breathing comfortably on room air, subjectively better and lung sounds markedly improved.  One urine legionella was sent at the time of discharge and will be followed by ID.  Her last dose of meropenem will be on [**2169-12-2**]. . # ?Lung Malignancy: BAL brushings from [**10/2169**] were suspicious for adenocarcinoma although definitive biopsy deferred while patient was hospitalized. The patient will follow-up with thoracic surgery for further evaluation and likely biopsy. . # Anemia: The patient has a chronic anemia with hematocrit baseline ~36. Iron studies during this admission are c/w anemia of chronic disease. Throughout the patient's stay here her hct has been ~30. Acute on chronic anemia thought to be a combination of repeated blood draws and immunosupression for underlying malignancy and infection. Reitc count of 0.4 is supportive of this. No e/o hemolysis or active bleeding.  There was some concern for medication induced marrow suppression and her cefepime was changed to meropenem.  With this change in her meds, her anemia stabilized.  She did require 1 unit of pRBC while on cefepime. . # RA/CREST: Chronic, on low dose prednisone. Managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3057**]. Prednisone was initially held in-house although re-started on transfer to the floor. Hydroxychloroquine held during active infection although will re-start after discharge. Methotrexate on Saturday per home dosing. . # HTN: Held diltiazem initially although will restart on discharge. . # Chronic rhinitis: Stable. Continued home fluticasone.  # Incidental findings: 11-mm thyroid isthmus nodule. Comparison with prior ultrasound examinations or a non-emergent ultrasound evaluation is recommended when  clinical stable.  # Transitional Issues: 1) Continue meropenem for 8 additional days to complete 10 day treatment course (last day [**2169-12-7**]) 2) Will need to re-address need for lung biopsy at upcomming thoracic surgery visit 3) F/u thoracic nodule as above 4) Repeat CBC at PCP appointment which should be within 1 week of discharge from rehab  \n",

Per his wife one week prior to admission he was falling/syncopizing at home and was also experiencing a fine tremor.  Per his wife when he had these episodes she saw him just fall with no prodrome, and hit his head on one occasion with a brief loss of consciousness.  His family also noted that he was having difficulty with confusion over the past 2-3 months, with worsening short term memory.  His wife also noted a shuffling gait, resting tremor and recently was found pouring milk into soup on the stove and kept pouring until the milk overflowed. With these symptoms his wife brought him to his PCP for evaluation, at that appointment he was noted to be confused, hypotensive to the 70's, not oriented to the day and then had a syncopal episode so his PCP referred him to the ER for evaluation of his altered mental status and for further work up prior to his hip replacement.  In the ER at the OSH his vital signs had stabilized, his he said that he remembered falling but otherwise felt well.  Denied any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea.  He was then admitted to \u001b[1m[**Hospital3 417**]\u001b[0m for a syncope work up. . During his hospital stay he was seen by neurology and cardiology for further evaluation of his syncope and mental status changes.  He was seen by psychiatry, neurology and cardiology in consultation.  Given the report of hs shuffling gait, and cognitive decline there was concern about early Parkinson's though he had no cogwheeling or rigidity on exam.  For further evaluation it was felt that he should undergo an MRI/MRA of his head, prior to these studies he received ativan for sedation. The ativan caused a paradoxical reaction and he became extremely agitated.  At that time he was given large amounts of haldol, a total of 17mg and required 4 point leather restraints and an eventual transfer to the ICU.  In the ICU after receiving the large amounts of sedating medications he became apneic and was intubated.  He had an EEG which showed diffuse slowing, there was also concern for a possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome vs. serotonin syndrome given his rigidity so he was given 1 dose of dantrolene, there was also concern about OSA and the need for CPAP, however they had difficulty weaning sedation.  On the day of transfer he became febrile, in the setting of his AMS there was concern about possible meningitis vs. encephalitis so an LP was done.  The LP showed 1WBC (100%lymphs), 1RBC, glucose of 76, protein of 99, Gram stain and culture pending at the time of transfer.  With his multiple problems and difficulty weaning sedation he was transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m for further management. . On the floor, his initial VS were: 101.6, 72, 147/63, 20, 97% on CMV 500x14, PEEP of 5, 40% FiO2.  \n",

He recovered from his VAP and is mental status improved by the time of discharge.  #) Altered Mental Status: initial cause is unclear, however given wife's report and documentation from the OSH there was concern for early onset Parkinson's and possible [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia, additionally his paradoxical reaction to ativan is concerning for an underlying dementia.  CSF was negative for signs of infection.  MRI was also negative for any acute intracranial process. Neurology was consulted and felt that his mental status changes were secondary to receiving benzodiazapines in the substrate of [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia.  He was sedated on propofol while intubated, and switched to presedex around the time of extubation.  Also while intubated, required several doses of seroquel for agitation.  Once extubated, patient was oriented to only person, and after speaking with family, seemed to be at baseline.  His confusioin became severe 24 hours later, with difficult to control agitation.  Recevied quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, haldol, trazodone with no improvement of agitation.  Required placement back on Precedex gtt for sedation.  Sent to floors with readmission to ICU for acute agitation.  Required Precedex gtt again for control of acute agitation.  Removed all antipsychotics.  Weaned off Precedex.  Return to nonagitated, pleasant state within 36 hours of ICU admission.  Had EEG that was non-suggestive of seizure. He will need full neurpsych and cognitive testing once his acute delerium resolves.  Continued on lamotrigine, which may need uptitration.  Seroquel for agitation has been suggested although not required for last 24 hours of admission.  #) Respiratory Failure: Patient initially intubated at OSH for altered mental status in the setting of recieving large amounts of haldol.  Failed extubation attempt on [**7-8**] and was reintubated.  CXR showed both pneumonia/aspiration pneumonitis and pulmonary edema. Patient was emperically started on vancomycin and zosyn. Sputum cultures grew MSSA, and patient was initially started on nafcillin, then swtiched to cefazolin after he developed drug rash.  Total course will be 7 days, Day 1 = [**7-12**]. He was eventually extubated on [**7-14**] once his mental status improved, pneumonia improved on CXR, and diuresis with IV Lasix.  He tolerated the extubation well.  #. SVT: On [**7-17**], patient flipped into SVT at 180, which resolved with carotid massage.  Likely AVRT or AVNRT.  Upon readmission to ICU, had sinus tachycardia and hypertension thought to be from agitation.  Started metoprolol 25 mg \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 **]\u001b[0m with good control.  #. Urinary Retention: Patient on terzosin at home.  He was switched to flomax secondary to hypotension and required intermittent straight caths while in the unit.  #) Hypertension: Patient on lisinopril and metoprolol at home. While intubated, these medications were held.  SBPs > 200 when patient was agitated.  He was started on a labetolol drip and BPs improved.  Once patient's sedation was changed to presedex, labetolol gtt was weaned off.  After extubation, his home BP medications were restarted, and on transfer to the floor, he was on metoprolol and lisinopril.  #) Bipolar Disorder: While patient was intubated, he was unable to take his home lamotrigine, cymbalta and wellbutrin as currently unable to get an NG or OG tube.  Lamotrigine was restarted as above.  #Sleep Apnea: found to have episodes of apnea with desaturations into the mid to low 80's.  Will need a sleep evaluation.  \n",

You became very agitated at the outside hospital and you required multiple medications for sedation and eventually needed to be intubated. Your intubation was complicated by a pneumonia and you were transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m for further management of your pneumonia and your mental status changes.  You were treated with a 7 day course of antibiotics for your pneumonia and you improved. You were seen by psychiatry and neurology. You again became very agitated and required IV sedation to control your agitation.  You then improved without additional medications.  \n",

      "TEXT: The patient is a 50 year-old right handed man with history of seizures (multiple status epilepticus episodes in the past), CAD (2 MIs, stents placed), PD, GERD, HPL, anxiety, depression, who was transferred here after being intubated for airway protection and status epilepticus control status post receiving a total of 6 mg ativan and 10 mg of valium at \u001b[1m[**Hospital3 4107**]\u001b[0m.  On the evening of [**7-30**], he was involved in an altercation at a bar (had 4 beers over the course of 3 hours). Following this altercation (~ 5 minutes), chest pain developed. The pain was crushing and tight, central in his chest, no radiations, [**6-21**], anxious. An ambulance arrived for him and transported him to \u001b[1m[**Hospital3 **]\u001b[0m.  He was told that he had a seizure (generalized tonic clonic) prior to EMS arriving (it resolved without any intervention)-he has no recollection of this. He was transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital3 4107**]\u001b[0m, where he received an EKG, CXR and CE test (all normal results. At \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 **]\u001b[0m, he developed 1 episode of generalized tonic clonic seizure which was responsive to 2 mg of Ativan. After this episode he had a cluster of seizures in an unknown period of time, not controlled by 4 mg of Ativan and 10 mg of Valium. Then he was intubated for airway protection, loaded with dilantin and started on propofol and Rocuronium. \u001b[1m[**Hospital **]\u001b[0m transferred to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m.  With regards to his epilepsy, he has a long-standing history since the age of 17 (with presentation of GTC, and myoclonic jerks); believed to be most likely primary generalized epilepsy. He states that his seizures can be varied in their presentation, from generalized tonic clonic to episodes of staring. He always experiences a LOC, has confusion following the events and headaches afterwards. He can go 6 months sometimes without having a seizure. He thinks that stress and flashing lights are triggers for his events. He experiences an aura of seeing sun spots approximately 1 min before his events. He states that for the most part he is compliant with his epilepsy medication, only missing a dose on evenings when he goes for a drink (after which he takes his dose when he arrives home). Prior to admission, he was on depakote 1000mg qid; he has been compliant with his medication, apart from missing one dose on [**7-30**].  Of note, he states that his last hospitalization for seizure was last month to \u001b[1m[**Hospital3 417**]\u001b[0m Hospital in \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 1474**]\u001b[0m, MA. He believes this was status epilepticus. Prior to this, he had gone from [**11/2117**] without seizures. He was admitted to \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m Epilepsy service twice in [**11/2117**] (once with status epilepticus in the setting of medication noncompliance (undetectable Depakote level) and alcohol ingestion. Has also been on phenytoin in the past which gave him headaches (plan to stop and begin another AED).  \n",

      "TEXT: The pt is a 50 year-old man with history of seizure and multiple status epilepticus episodes in the past, who was transferred here after being intubated for airway protection and status epilepticus control.  # NEUROLOGIC: Cause of status epilepticus most likely secondary to noncompliance with medications as valproic acid level was subtherapeutic at 25 on admission. Also, given frequency of seizures, his regimen of valproic acid 1000mg qid was likely not adequate as a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]. No electrolyte abnormality was present. Alcohol W/D versus intoxication is also on the differential. Head CT was w/o acute process. He was continued on home dose of Depakote and also started on Dilantin initially. Patient was successfully extubated on [**7-31**]. He did say that he was on Depakote 1000mg qid at home. Has also been on Dilantin in the past which gave him headaches and caused him to be unsteady on his feet causing him to discontinue and start Keppra 500mg \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 **]\u001b[0m instead. Of note, on am of [**8-1**], patient had blinking of eyes b/l. At this time, he had no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Of note, pt was on Diazepam 10mg TID per home dosing and CIWA protocol. He was also hydrated with banana bag on admission and then transitioned to PO folic acid and thiamine.  Follow up conversation with Mr. [**Known lastname 69467**] [**Last Name (Titles) 92605**] the need for medication compliance, with neurology appointment follow-ups at \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m.  Depakote and Valium were both continued upon outpatient discharge.  # PSYCHIATRIC: Pt with history of being abused and 4 suicide attempts in the past.  During admission in ICU, endorsed passive SI but did not have a plan to hurt himself. Psychiatry evaluated Mr. [**Known lastname 69467**] noting his features of depression and PTSD; they noted the patient would likely benefit from psychotherapy as well as possible medication adjustment (esp higher dose SSRI); however, no safety concerns were reported for the patient. Of note, the patient also refused placement or any psychiatric counseling.  # CARDIOLOGY: Monitored on telemetry.  No abnormal rhythm was noted.  # TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**], \u001b[1m[**Hospital1 18**]\u001b[0m Neurology, and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6339**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] his PCP.  \n",

On 5-10, he was taken to the OR by an outside surgeon and underwent subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy.

      "Brief Hospital Course: Mr. POMPONI arrived on a ventilator and was aggressively resuscitated using invasive monitoring. He was given intravenous boluses, transfused blood products and was placed on four pressors: Levophed, Neo-Synephrine, Dobutamine, and Pitressin. (Later, pt was also placed on epinephrine gtt as well.) Pt arrived with a Swan WAELTI catheter, and cardiac parameters were hyperdynamic.  Given the pt's cardiac hx and mildly elevated cardiac enzyme, a STAT cardiology consult was obtained. STAT TTE showed preserved EF and no grossly abnormal wall motions. There was no pericardial effusion. All these findings essentially ruled out cardiogenic shock.  Pt arrived anuric to St. Paul. Pt was acidodic as well. Pt was started on sodium bicarbonate gtt. Nephrology consult was obtained. L femoral dialysis line was placed, and pt was initiated on CVVH.  LFT's began to rise, indicating likely shock liver.  Presuming septic shock, pt was given broad spectrum IV antibiotics. Given the severity of the shock, he was also started on activated Protein C gtt.  Despite all these measures, pt required increasingly higher doses of all the pressors to maintain bp. Serum lactic acid level peaked to > 10. Ventilation was difficult, requiring FiO2 of 1.0 and high PEEP.  Family members were present and understood the critical state of pt's multi-organ failure. When pt's blood pressure could not be maintained, family members decided to make the pt DNR. Slowly, pt became bradycardic and hypotensive. Cardiac arrest ensued. Pt was pronounced deceased 4:45am, 2022-5-5. Cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest due to septic shock.  \n",

She notes generalized abdominal pain, worst in the suprapubic region.  Also decreased PO intake.  No chest pain or SOB. No dysuria. No recent travel or sick contacts. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 104.5, P 129, BP 122/74, R 20, O2 sat 96% RA. Exam was notable for tenderness in the right and left lower quadrants, in addition to initial examination showing cervical motion tenderness.  She became progressively hypotensive and tachycardic with systolic BP down to the 70s. She was given 6 liters of normal saline.  A right femoral central venous line was placed and levophed was initiated. OB/Gyn was consulted out of concern for pelvic inflammatory disease.  Pelvic ultrasound was negative.  Her intrauterine device was removed. OB/Gyn did not feel her examination or ultrasound findings were consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease. Her chest X-Ray was clear.  CT abd/pelvis was also unremarkable for acute pathology.  She received unasyn and doxycycline initially for antibiotic coverage.  When she clinically worsened, vanco and clindamycin were added.  In addition, she was given zofran, tylenol, and toradol.  As the patient had been sexually active on the morning of admission and her IUD was removed, she was also given plan B.  She was then admitted to the Chaplaincy for close monitoring. . On arrival to the Chaplaincy, she feels very warm as if she is spiking a temp and complains of overall fatigue.  ',\n",

She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock related to E coli bacteremia. She was treated initially with Unasyn and Vancomycin empirically. However, vancomycin was discontinued once culture data returned. The source of the Ecoli sepsis was unclear. BUMATAY liver ultrasound was normal; transthoracic echocardiography did not reveal vegetation; and abdominal/pelvic CT did not show any acute intra-abdominal process. Despite low suspicion for pelvic inflammatory disease, her intrauterine device was removed, but her urine culture and gonococcal/chlamydia cervical sample were both negative. She also did not have purulent cervical discharge, nor marked cervical motion tenderness. Her normal liver ultrasound and tests along with unremarkable CT abdomen lowered the possibility of biliary source of infection. Taken altogether, the E. coli sepsis was likely acquired as a consequence of infectious gastroenteritis, possibly through mild ulceration of the colonic surface allowing bacterial translocation. She became afebrile and her abdominal pain improved. Her WBC was 24 on admission and was normal on discharge. She was seen by the ID service. She was discharged on Cefpodoxime to finish a course of 14 days of antibiotics. She was instructed to see her PCP at the end of her antibiotic therapy on 2021-11--17.  ',\n",

The left kidney measures 9 cm and is diffusely echogenic consistent with medical renal disease. No hydronephrosis or masses are present.  IMPRESSION: Diffusely echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal disease. Right renal cyst with calcifications is unchanged in size. The right renal upper pole lesion seen on the prior CT was difficult to visualize on this examination. . 12-28 CXR: Comparison is made to the prior study from 2135-8-20. Median sternotomy wires and cardiomegaly is again seen and unchanged. There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion as well as pleural plaques along the right chest. This is stable. There is increased prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggesting an element of fluid overload. The aorta is tortuous. There is minimal blunting of the left CP angle suggestive of a small effusion. There is also some increased density at the left base which may represent an early infiltrate versus atelectasis. . 12-31 MRI abd/pelvis: There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. In fact, there is paucity of fluid within the collecting systems, which may represent reduced production of urine. There is no perinephric fluid or fat stranding.  There are multiple bilateral renal cysts that demonstrate slight increase in size compared to MRI of five years ago. The largest on the left measures 1.7 cm. The slightly septated cyst in the right upper pole measures 13 mm, stable from previous exam. The new cystic lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney measures 1.5 cm. On ASL-MRI, it does not demonstrate any flow to suggest a neoplasm. It is also noted that there is paucity of signal in the renal parenchyma on the ASL images. Apparent reduced perfusion in the kidney which may represent a sequela or cause of patient's decreased renal function.  The liver is unremarkable. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The CBD is dilated up to 12 mm in the porta hepatis and tapers normally down to the ampulla. Adrenals, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable. There is interval increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions from CT scan of 2137-7-28, with associated atelectasis/consolidation. It is also noted that the IVC size in the intrahepatic and infrahepatic portions is large, which may represent fluid overload status.  MRI OF THE PELVIS: There is a Foley catheter in a near-empty bladder. There is a small amount of hemorrhagic fluid in the bladder lumen. The bladder wall is significantly thickened up to 15 mm, probably related to prior radiation treatments in conjunction with nondistention. The T2-weighted images through the pelvis are degenerated by motion and breathing artifact, however, a short segment of the distal ureter, about 1.5 cm distal to the left UVJ, appears to be significantly thickened up to 7 mm (7:20). There is no dilation of the ureter proximal to this segment. The right distal ureter is difficult to assess due to motion artifact. There is a small amount of nonhemorrhagic free fluid in the pelvis. There is no adenopathy. IMPRESSION: 1. No hydronephrosis or reversible cause for renal failure identified. 2. No perfusion in the cystic renal mass in the right upper pole of the kidney. Apparent reduced perfusion in the kidney which may represent a sequela or cause of patient's decreased renal function. 3. Thickened bladder and a short segment of distal left ureter thickening without proximal obstruction. 4. New bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis/consolidation, and increased pelvic free fluid. The case was discussed and reviewed with Dr. KUERBITZ at 5:30 p.m., 2137-12-31. The patient will be brought back for a non-contrast urographic study pre- and post-Lasix administration. . 1-3 CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including cardiomegaly, post-sternotomy wires and post-CABG changes. Multifocal opacities seen throughout the lungs are redemonstrated, mostly involving the right lower lobe associated with right pleural effusion. Overall, the appearance has slightly improved since the prior study, which is most likely due to improvement of superimposed pulmonary edema. The calcifications of the pleura in the right chest wall are unchanged. . 1-6 bladder u/s: The urinary bladder is normally distended. An indwelling Foley catheter is noted with an inflated balloon. Echogenic debris measures with maximum cross-sectional dimension 5.0 x 1.4 x 2.0 cm (TRV x AP x CC), layering in the dependent position of the urinary bladder, compatible with blood clot. There is no free fluid in the visualized pelvic region. IMPRESSION: Echogenic blood clot layering in the otherwise normally-distended urinary bladder. . 1-8 CXR: Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is longstanding. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased since 1-3, after previously decreasing. I doubt that there is pneumonia, and pulmonary vascular congestion is relatively stable so I do not think there is pulmonary edema either. Extensive right pleural calcification is longstanding. . 1-11 CXR: There are small bilateral pleural effusions with possible interval increase in pleural fluid on the left. There is an area of focally increased density at the right base that appears increased since the previous study and a small area of pneumonia cannot be excluded. This might be better evaluated by CT if further evaluation is warranted. Interstitial markings are increased and there may be an element of underlying interstitial edema as well.  \",\n",
       " 'brief_hospital_course': 'Mr. WHITEGOAT is a 98 y/o Russian M with PMHx of 90 cancer with recent indwelling foley, stage IV CKD (baseline Cr 3.0) and chronic systolic CHF (LVEF 30%) who was admitted on 12-26 with anemia, hematuria and clot-related urinary retention.  He was initially admitted to the Urology Service for urinary clot retention and was taken to the operating room for cystoscopy, clot evacuation, and bladder fulguration.   Pt was admitted to Neurology post procedure due to urosepsis from Klebseilla UTI. Pt developped presumed ATN and worsening renal failure post procedure. Pt had some recovery of renal function but developped recurrent hematuria requiring multiple blood transfusions. During this prolonged admission, he required multiple urologic procedures for recurrent hematuria with obstructive clotting. On 1-8, he was taken for cystoscopy which was complicated by an episode of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure thought due to procedural sedation.  He was again transferred to the Neurology and his acidosis improved with BiPaP. Pt was transferred back out to the medicine floor on 1-11. While on the medicine floor, the continuous bladder irrigation was discontinued and his hematocrit stabilized at 25-27.   Foley was removed and he did had any acute issues with retention.  He did have one transient episode of scant hematuria which resolved spontaneously.  Pt continued to have normal UOP with mildly elevated PVRs and stable creatinine.   Urology recommended avoiding a foley unless pt develops severe pain or acute obstruction given his severe hematuria. . Specific issues: C diff: Pt was noted to have a rising leukocytosis and Cdiff toxin returned positive.  Symptoms were improving on po Flagyl and he was discharged with a prescription to complete another 10 days of flagyl at home. . Acute on chronic renal failure: By the time of discharge, his renal function seemed stabilized at a creatinine of 3.6-3.9.  He had been adequately diuresed for his acute systolic heart failure and was clinically euvolemic on lasix dose of 40mg twice daily.    Lisinopril was stopped and follow up labs will be drawn 4 days after discharge and forwarded to Dr. MCTHUNE and Dr. MCTHUNE.   Pt will be seen in St Vincent Randolph Hospital Inc Geisinger - Bloomsburg Hospital clinic on 1-30. . Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Pt was hypervolemic after fluid rescucitation in the ICU and required diuresis with IV lasix. He  was discharged on a new home dose of lasix 40mg Tristar Summit Medical Center which was confirmed with Dr. MCTHUNE. . SOBLE cancer/cystitis: PSA had been slowly increasing over past one year.  Pt is now s/p cytoscopy and fulguration.  Dr. MCTHUNE recommended starting Casodex as an inpatient but this has been deferred after d/w patient and daughter. . Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled, all anticoagulation held in setting of hematuria. . # Code status: DNR/DNI  ',\n",

She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock related to E coli bacteremia. She was treated initially with Unasyn and Vancomycin empirically. However, vancomycin was discontinued once culture data returned. The source of the Ecoli sepsis was unclear. METTY liver ultrasound was normal; transthoracic echocardiography did not reveal vegetation; and abdominal/pelvic CT did not show any acute intra-abdominal process. Despite low suspicion for pelvic inflammatory disease, her intrauterine device was removed, but her urine culture and gonococcal/chlamydia cervical sample were both negative. She also did not have purulent cervical discharge, nor marked cervical motion tenderness. Her normal liver ultrasound and tests along with unremarkable CT abdomen lowered the possibility of biliary source of infection. Taken altogether, the E. coli sepsis was likely acquired as a consequence of infectious gastroenteritis, possibly through mild ulceration of the colonic surface allowing bacterial translocation. She became afebrile and her abdominal pain improved. Her WBC was 24 on admission and was normal on discharge. She was seen by the ID service. She was discharged on Cefpodoxime to finish a course of 14 days of antibiotics. She was instructed to see her PCP at the end of her antibiotic therapy on 2021-11--17.  ',\n",

      "Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 33 year-old woman who presented with two weeks of malaise and a three day history of worsening abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock related to E coli bacteremia. She was treated initially with Unasyn and Vancomycin empirically. However, vancomycin was discontinued once culture data returned. The source of the Ecoli sepsis was unclear. METTY liver ultrasound was normal; transthoracic echocardiography did not reveal vegetation; and abdominal/pelvic CT did not show any acute intra-abdominal process. Despite low suspicion for pelvic inflammatory disease, her intrauterine device was removed, but her urine culture and gonococcal/chlamydia cervical sample were both negative. She also did not have purulent cervical discharge, nor marked cervical motion tenderness. Her normal liver ultrasound and tests along with unremarkable CT abdomen lowered the possibility of biliary source of infection. Taken altogether, the E. coli sepsis was likely acquired as a consequence of infectious gastroenteritis, possibly through mild ulceration of the colonic surface allowing bacterial translocation. She became afebrile and her abdominal pain improved. Her WBC was 24 on admission and was normal on discharge. She was seen by the ID service. She was discharged on Cefpodoxime to finish a course of 14 days of antibiotics. She was instructed to see her PCP at the end of her antibiotic therapy on 2021-11--17.  \n",
